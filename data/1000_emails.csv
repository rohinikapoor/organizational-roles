crowdis of think energy on tuesday with a variety of pricing proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags to green tags with embedded call options richard and i are working together to develop pricing for tags in the pac northwest california texas and the east i feel good about our chances of getting something done with these guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so many public declarations of intent as we move forward i think we should all do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this type of product once the enron building is juiced with wind power we will be able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and encourage them to become green power alliance customers during the week of september 11 i plan to be in houston to work extensively on drawing up the guidelines for the alliance program and working more closely with richard and stacey and their ees contacts to develop green power products for upstream marketing and new origination effortselliot meeting with wind subc on thursday 920 at 800 ambeldon and herndon are renewable products  get product descriptions to both09one page description of renewable energy product09re  ee  energy auditlos angeles department of water and power  ladwp is the largest green power buyer among public power agencies in california their green power buyer is heavily understaffed and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowledge he has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruition manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable power products through enron s existing master services agreement with ladwp this is an exciting although not very profitable at this point opportunity to establish the nodes of the california renewable power pool and we see this as a way to bring our services desk functions to bear on the renewable sector in california i am meeting with fpl energy next week to discuss becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in californialadwp2009unresponsive at present09volumes can be doubled under current contract

large parcel of windy land in central washington with enxco a wind development concern we are marketing the project to two of the munis in the pacific northwest seattle city light and eugene water and electric board both have expressed interest this morning i am meeting with the city of portland to try to convince portland to follow seattle s lead as a zerocarbon growth city and signatory to the type of kyotoesque committments recently announced by new england legislatorsleave that to enron wind etcupside limited compared to time spentconcentrate on niche  marketingservices and downstream saleseol  need a more liquid market  more demandrenewable portfolio standard  the proposed ca rps has major implications for our business from both a risk management and commercial opportunity perspective we need to really drill down on this today and get as much insight as to the political climate as possible having witnessed the first meeting of the california power authority last friday in sacramento i am personally convinced that the rps will definitely be passed in some shape or form if they pass a 1 requirement for new renewables next year this translates into 430mwm off a 43000mw peak load in ca we have very good working relationships with several of the biomass generators in california including generators with new resources and we are actively negotiating a marketing agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the next couple of years the critical question of course is who will actually have the short position in california if it is just the dwr then they will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases if the utilities end up serving load they will be in the market looking for the leastcost resources and new biomass will clearly be a part of the mixnational rps  follow up with john shelkstir up demandpac northwest rfps  both pacificorp and portland general electric have rfps out right now for green tags and retail marketing services i am staying in touch with bonneville environmental foundation green mountain energy and community energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions i want to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to make it really easy for them to transact with us we can use our market legs to get wellpriced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for rfp successes bonneville environmental at a minimum will need new biomass to blend in with their expensive wind energy tagschicago  most of you probably met mike lindert at our houston renewables meeting earlier this month he was the ees originator for the comed deal and as you know there is a significant renewable committment in chicago we need to get in front of the city of chicago as soon as possible to talk about their next generation of renewable purchases stacey i belive you have info on thiselliot got follow up email on 917 from mike lindert  sign up for alliance

in austin september 10  11 they are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us to attend if you are interested in heading up there for a day with me please let me know there should be a pretty good turnout among potential commercial and industrial customerskinkos  all indications are that our negotiations with kinko s are going very well the hope is to sell them a threeyear fixedprice retail product and 100 wind tags richard and i are woking to source the tags success will be huge as kinkos is part of the green power market development groupmight be deadi know that richard and stacey have other deals on the table and jesse has been busy working on finalizing our services deal with edwards air force base i look forward to seeing you guys in houston the week of

denis.o connell@enron.com,justin.boyd@enron.com|mark.e.taylor@enron.com|mark.e.taylor@enron.com,justin further to our conversation yesterday i have reviewed the existing hdd swap gtc s  in contrast to the financial gtc s which when read with the eta are drafted on the basis that the gtc s only apply if an isda has not been executed  the hdd swap gtc s have been drafted to work in unison with the isda framework  the hdd swap gtc together with the specific documentation for each transaction constitutes a confirmation under the isda form   i have made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the carve out of the language in the eta which provides that gtc s will only apply if an isda has been executed incidentally  with respect to the eta  it seems to provide that the relevant gtc s will apply in respect of a transaction if an isda is not in place on the trade date of such transaction however it does not seem to make any provision for circumstances where an isdamaster agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a transaction   in such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the eta the preexisting transaction would continued to be governed by the gtc but future transactions would be governed by the isdamaster agreement  from a netting perspective this is not ideal  is this the intention give me a shout when you have had a chance to review the attacheddenis

of material is that once it is out of our control we will no longer have any idea of how many copies were made who had access to the material or know how it was stored and protected  therefore it is in our best interest to reduce the information copied electronically to only what is essential  if printing is adequate then i would recommend that brobeck print the documents that are responsive to the subpoena   april has set up appropriate access to the system and files so that they can be reviewed in your office spaces  i have spoken with peter and promised that i would get your input as well as richard sanders on the issue  please give me a call if you have any questions  best regards  gabriellaps  i have placed some comments in red next to each of peter s pointsoriginal messagefrom

email and electronicdocuments in the possession of certain employees in enron s san franciscooffice  as we discussed this email sets forth our request and our reasonsthis request  i truly appreciate you discussing this issue with richardsanders and dave parquet  request  we request that enron copy onto cd s certain electronic documentsand emails in the possession of dave parquet sue mara and mike mcdonaldthereafter we will review these documents and produce only those documentsand emails that are responsive to subpoenas from the california senate andthe california attorney general  the documents and emails we request to becopied likely contain documents and emails not responsive to these twooutstanding subpoenas  reasons for request  you raise valid concerns with our proposal insofar aswe ask for copies of documents and emails that are not responsive to thesubpoenas  we believe our proposal is the best approach for followingreasons 1 we can accurately keep control of what we have reviewed what wehave deemed responsive and what we have deemed privileged  folders can be set up for filing and tracking these documents gc 2 we can rereview materials in the likely event of furthersubpoenas or documents requests  all documents and emails are to be retained so that they will be available for future reviews gc 3 we can review the materials in the least disruptive mannerpossible  on our own computers and in our offices operating from your office may be an inconvenience but it minimizes the risk of losing control of sensitive documents that have no bearing on the case gc 4 we can review at the pace dictated by the litigation which isunpredictable to say the least  as long as access to your office spaces and the system is made available this should not be an issue gcconcerns about security and confidentiality are common in all litigation anddocument review  we always take these concerns seriously  we will restrictaccess to these documents to only those persons involved with reviewing andorganizing the documents  we will work with you to ensure that thesedocuments will remain in strict confidenceagain i truly appreciate your taking the time to

thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers a senate committee investigating price gouging in california s wholesale electricity market subpoenaed enron s documents in april seeking records of electricity sales bidding strategies prices and outofstate transactionsthe company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records enron sued july 11 and on thursday sacramento county superior court judge charles c kobayashi granted the company s request for a protective order the judge noted in his order that enron is a business competitor of the california department of water resources which began buying electricity on behalf of the state s two largest utilities last january although the committee argues that the senate is not in competition with plaintiff wrote kobayashi the functions of the senate and the department of water resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict actual conflicts can arise kobayashi s order is a reversal of an earlier tentative ruling in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for enron would be an unacceptable intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the legislature karen denne a spokeswoman for the houstonbased company described executives as very pleased with the court ruling turning over the documents was never the issue she said the issue was always protecting our rights enron officials will work with committee chairman sen joe dunn dsanta ana to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides denne said reliant energy of houston another company that resisted demands for business records on wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with dunn s committee and will begin bringing 250000 documents to a depository in sacramento said reliant spokesman marty wilson dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to sacramento but not all are fully complying with subpoenas there are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants he said on july 21 the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market voted to recommend that enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents the full senate has yet to vote on that recommendation the committee which the senate created in march has focused its investigation on the private companies that

senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state s energy crisis a california judge ruled on thursday but sacramento superior court judge charles kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide enron with a confidentiality agreement saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm s right to maintain proprietary secretsif the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights attorneys to surrender their attorneyclient privilege and psychiatrists to surrender their privileges the judge wrote the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations california power agencies and utilities were overcharged some 89 billion for wholesale electricity during the state s energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state s poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries an enron spokeswoman said on thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets for example would be protected under a confidentiality agreement the firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement said enron spokeswoman karen denne we are pleased with the judge s order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected denne said the issue has always been protecting the confidential documents the committee has already asked the full senate to cite enron as well as reliant energy inc for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents it would be the first such citation imposed by the state senate since 1929 but has not yet come up for a vote atlantabased mirant corp however avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators  demands to sign confidentiality agreements

the protective order ruling a victory this gives us the confidentiality agreement we ve been seeking the order s specifics will be worked out with sen joe dunn dsanta ana the committee chairman it will then be signed by a judge once both sides agree enron officials have offered to turn over 25000 documents that were already in california but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena the committee found enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents a full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full senate which has not voted on it a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate a contempt finding against mirant corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee s investigators

hispanic community monday pitching the 175 million plan to a grassroots group of latino leaders more than 150 community activists and leaders precinct judges and civicassociation members attended an informational meeting and getoutthevote rally for the nov 7 arena referendum the rally was sponsored by the let s build it together political action committee by having our hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said celina garzaridge a harris countyhouston sports authority director it s very important to be able to say the hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position george postolos the houston rockets  chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the hispanic community the proarena committee headed by former reliant energy chairman don jordan and ken lay enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the 1999 referendum voters last november soundly defeated the previous arena proposal the sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues the rockets made a 30percent participation commitment similar to the one made four years ago by the houston astros for enron field to fairly share the new arena s design and construction jobs with minorities and women the team also promised to distribute up to 50000 a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to 1000 each to worthy grassroots nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in innercity houston the new program targets the hispanic community postolos said the new arena plan is being endorsed by a crosssection of latino leaders including city councilmen john castillo and gabriel vasquez state rep mario gallegos the hispanic chamber of commerce and others vasquez told meeting attendees that the city and the hispanic community is getting more tangibles this time around he said when you consider that our community will get 30 percent affirmative action that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well this is a really good deal for houston and this is a really good deal for the hispanic community mercedes alejandro who represents parents for public schools of houston heard the details of the plan for the first time it s good if it creates jobs for the community and opportunities to rebuild the community she said we want it to be good for the whole not the few humberto barrera president of the mexican american sheriffs organization was critical of hispanic leaders not the arena plan i think hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers health care and public safety than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs barrera said richard torres director and ceo of the hispanic chamber of commerce told attendees that the rockets are committed to doing the right thing sergio davila president of the eastwood civic association brought up the lack of latinos in leadership positions on the team s staff postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better  tva says enron breach of power sales pact cost 140 mlnby bryan lee10162000dow jones energy servicecopyright c 2000 dow jones  company incof dow jones newswires washington dow jones the nation s top two power providers are battling in a us court over an unexecuted power sales agreementthe tennessee valley authority tva has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of enron corp ene alleging breach of a power sales contract tva cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the governmentowned utility s inability to meet its debtreduction forecast according to the documents obtained by dow jones newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a 140 million shortfall during fiscal year 2000 tva was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order a major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said david smith tva s chief financial officer when asked friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to tva s distribution utility customers but after consulting with attorneys smith revealed that enron was the subject of the claim tva alleged breach of contract after enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the us district court in chattanooga tenn in february stemming from a dispute over a longterm sales agreement an enron spokesman said monday in march tva filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a tva spokesman said monday but the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judge s protective order tva said enron sought the court seal the dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the houstonbased energy giant and tva a governmentowned utility that ranks among the largest us power producers the relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative us midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999 after the summer of 1998  in which power that typically sells for between 30 and 50 per megawatthour spiked as high as 7000 per megawatthour  enron cited a study showing that tva s power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the midwest tva experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward enron built gasfired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across tva s system after the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility enron began complaining that tva was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests a tva spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility s handling of transmissionaccess requests but the filing of the court case occurred at the same time enron went public with its complaints about tva s transmission service in february enron released a letter to energy secretary bill richardson asking for the government s help charging that tva was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while enron s requests were gathering dust enron later dropped the matter saying that tva was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis by bryan lee dow jones newswires 2028626647 bryanleedowjonescomcopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights

public utilities commission505 public utilities commissionsan francisco california   94102  re   i0008002  subpoenas served on enron powermarketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enronenergy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energymarketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporationportland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enronentitiesharvey here are our proposals with respect to the enron entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe california public utility commission hereinafter the commissionthe enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the california electric markets byproducing the information specified on a timely basis  we believe that thelimited production we propose will enable the commission to commence itsinvestigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all ofthe potential objections to the requests for production which are by anystandard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documentswe make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of october 3 2000with the understanding that the commission agrees that by cooperatingoffering to produce or producing documents the enron entities have notwaived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and thatany claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or otherresponses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the futureif necessary   for all of these proposals we exclude documents that areprotected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work productprivileges generally speaking the enron entities propose to produce documentsfor year 2000 as noted below  we also understand that the commission willbe obtaining documents from the iso and px and we will not attempt here toduplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entitiesas you will see in the general documents that are offered here forproduction enron energy services operations inc is the parent of enronenergy services inc and does not have operating authority or engage inwholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy  thus the documentsoffered here with respect to those two entities originates with enron energyservices inc but we have designated them both as ees  we also do notpropose to offer duplicative documents as between the enron entitiesgeneral documentsrequests 1 through 4 because of the dynamic nature of the enron entities  businesses theburden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporateorganizational chart anywhere in their organizations since april 1 1998 issignificant   the enron entities will provide the commission with exemplarsof their current organizational charts telephone directories and so calledfamily trees to show its current organization  to the extent that theenron entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significantorganizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees forearlier periods they will also make those available  one enron entityportland general has published books on its corporate history  if a listof those books would be helpful we can provide it  with respect to theother enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be foundthey will be produced  we anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on october 13 2000requests 5 and 6 the enron entities propose that their responses to requests 14 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transactiondocuments will identify its customers and suppliers  we believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaff s purposesfinancial documentsrequests 7 through 11 the enron entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data  epmi ees and portland generalwill provide to the commission electronic transaction data  thetransaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data   we anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on october 13 2000 and the electronic transactiondocuments in the second wave of document productionsgenerating documentsrequests 12 14 and 18 for the enron entities other than portland general the generationfacilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available  the enron entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested  the enron entities other than portland generaldo have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration  we propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions  for portland general the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand  as a result we question whether theeffort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on thecalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited  in addition thosetransactions which do involve portland general sales into california arelimited to sales to the iso and px and long term contracts with two smallcalifornia municipal utilities  thus the commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the iso andpx  nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year 2000electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other enron entities to the extent relevant as discussed belowwe propose that the commission defer requesting production of otherinformation until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell asignificant proportion of their energy into the california market  at thattime a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effortwill be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation onthe california wholesale markettransaction documentsrequests 13 15 16 17 and 19 we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and pxepmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year 2000 in california and outside of california andreal time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the datecounterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is apurchase or a sale   because of the speed with which you want thisinformation it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate  for thosetransactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator weunderstand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quicklythe reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmi scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness  ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to ees confidentiality obligations to those customers  we anticipate producing thetransaction documents in the second wave of document productionsferc documentsrequest 20 the enron entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies ofthose responses  we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october 132000 based upon discussions that we have had with the various enronentities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onfriday october 27 2000  it is possible that not all enron entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place that all of the enron entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order  in addition if at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the

rod.hayslett@enron.com,danny.mccarty@enron.com,our typical ferc out is not very useful in reality since it is unlikely that we will not get an ok rate from a ferc perspective but highly unlikely we will get an allowed rate of return high enough to satisfy the current enron hurdle rates    negotiated rates in these types of deals basis for new builds have been allowed to stand for the life of the contracts in the case of kern river and mojave   but in reality ferc can always change their mind and that is a risk that we will model in the deal original messagefrom  mccarty danny  sent wednesday june 20 2001 310 pmto hayslett rodsubject transpecos letter of intent with pemexrod        the negotiated rate is intended to provide us sufficient returns to meet or exceed corporate hurdle rates  if ferc does not allow us to charge our proposed initial rate we have the option not to build the project pursuant to 4b  we will change 2d to provide a flat negotiated rate per dthd rather than capping the rate at the mawimum rate allowed by ferc  we do have a risk that ferc might revisit its negotiated rate policy  which is the same risk that we run with the red rock expansion  any other ideasdan

paul cherrygpgfinenronenron danny mccartyetsenronenron subject transpecos letter of intent with pemexrodi hear you  however what s changed since the last time you and i spoke about this project is that our friend bill wise has been talking with the chairman of pemex about doing a similar 180 mile expansion of el paso s system from waha to samalayuca  his proposal was to provide incremental firm service to pemex at epng s currently effective texas rates low 20 cent range  pemex management is willing to recommend to its board of directors going with a slightly higher rate on transpecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage but the transpecos rate needs to be as close to epng s as possible to make the case compelling  therefore what we re trying to accomplish here is to give pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap with an upside that if the ferc rate is less than the cap which it might well be then pemex gets the lower rate  it s just going to be damned difficult to hit a mcgwire home run here with el paso breathing down our neck  i truly believe this is the best we can negotiate for fear of pemex going back to their comfort zone with epng  dan mccarty was with me in our last meeting in mexico city and i think he was reading the tea leaves similarly original messagefrom  hayslett rod  sent wednesday june 20 2001 655 amto fawcett jefferycc centilli james peters jerry cherry paulsubject re transpecos letter of intent with pemexwe will get allowed whatever we get from ferc but i am here to tell you that if that the ferc allowed rate is the best we can do then we will have a more difficult time convincing enron to invest the equity    why in the deal are we limiting our upside to the maximum rate allowed by ferc 2d    our current return level is about 19 on equity with 60 leverage applied so anything less than that reduces our overall return to enron     because this is a partnership we will be off balance sheet and will have met the first hurdle    the second hurdle will be arranging nonrecourse financing guaranties during construction ok  original messagefrom  fawcett jeffery  sent tuesday june 19 2001 1226 pmto cherry paulcc hayslett rod centilli jamessubject transpecos letter of intent with pemexpauli think james centilli is running his model against a 15 rate of return on equity  i don t know if the ferc would otherwise provide for a 15 return unless a case could be made for the higher rate to compensate the partners for the credit riskcost of noninvestment grade financingi think this is a call maybe for rod hayslett to make with respect to ferc regulated roe  if we think 15 is insufficient then what is the appropriate levelregardsjeff original messagefrom  cherry paul  sent tuesday june 19 2001 1026 amto fawcett jefferycc peters jerry hayslett rodsubject re transpecos letter of intent with pemexjeffin reference to the project the comment i would offer is in regard to the currrent sp rating of pemex presently they are rated from usd perspective of bb and in pesos bbb due to their usd rating of one level below investment grade the question was raised by jerry if the rate of return would increase also it is my understanding that the contracting entity is mgi supply and pemex would provide a guarantyregardsfrom jeffery fawcettenronenronxgate on 06152001 1138 amto drew

6 via the site index page at httpmembersfortunecitycomcorruptioningovernment            the referenced letter stated the florida state board of administration which administers florida s public pension plans will be seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the pending texas class action against enron and others            such action appears to be joining to administer a death blow to enron stockholders as a service to international organized crime whose agents as wall street market operators have severely and extensively watered enron and other securities through the sale of bogus counterfeit receipts   whereas the real responsible entities in the case of enron are the new york stock exchange officers and specialists serving those profiting via the secret omnibus accounts through which funds from the sale of bogus counterfeit receipts are distributed to secret unidentified parties   the existence of those secret omnibus accounts has been documented in us congressional reports            certain officers of enron corporation obviously have been privy to certain aspects of the aforecited illicit activities and deliberately helped to set up enron corporation for bankruptcy   in doing so they were privy to planned negative manipulation of enron securities prices and rewarded by early and profitable sales of securities held by them            again may i caution against actions detrimental to enron stockholders while transferring blame and liability to the corporation and naive officers fallguys thereof while ignoring the real criminal parties whose

is a far less glitzy place but there s still such a  thing as an it20stock right now that title belongs to enron the  houston energy giant20while tech stocks were bombing at the box office  last year fans couldn t20get enough of enron whose shares returned 89  by almost every measure the20company turned in a virtuoso performance  earnings increased 25 and20revenues more than doubled to over 100  billion not surprisingly the20critics are gushing enron has built  unique and in our view extraordinary20franchises in several usiness  units in very large markets says goldman20sachs analyst david fleischer20along with it status come high multiples and high expectations enron  now20trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings that s more than 2 12  times20the multiple of a competitor like duke energy more than twice  that of the20s02500 and about on a par with neweconomy sex symbol  cisco systems enron20has an even higher opinion of itself at a  latejanuary meeting with20analysts in houston the company declared that  it should be valued at 126 a20share more than 50 above current levels  enron has no shame in telling20you what it s worth says one portfolio  manager who describes such20gatherings as revival meetings indeed  first call says that 13 of enron s2018 analysts rate the stock a buy20but for all the attention that s lavished on enron the company remains 20largely impenetrable to outsiders as even some of its admirers are  quick to20admit start with a pretty straightforward question how  exactly does enron20make its money details are hard to come by because  enron keeps many of the20specifics confidential for what it terms  competitive reasons and the20numbers that enron does present are often  extremely complicated even20quantitatively minded wall streeters who  scrutinize the company for a living20think so if you figure it out let  me know laughs credit analyst todd20shipman at sp do you have a  year asks ralph pellecchia fitch s credit20analyst in response to the  same question20to skeptics the lack of clarity raises a red flag about enron s pricey 20stock even owners of the stock aren t uniformly sanguine i m somewhat 20afraid of it admits one portfolio manager and the inability to get  behind20the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the  company may20increase the chance of a nasty surprise enron is an  earningsatrisk20story   says chris wolfe the equity market strategist  at jp morgan s20private bank who despite his remark is an enron fan  if it doesn t meet20earnings the stock could implode20what s clear is that enron isn t the company it was a decade ago in  199020around 80 of its revenues came from the regulated gaspipeline  business20but enron has been steadily selling off its oldeconomy iron  and steel20assets and expanding into new areas in 2000 95 of its  revenues and more20than 80 of its operating profits came from wholesale  energy operations and20services this business which enron pioneered  is usually described in20vague grandiose terms like the  financialization of energybut also more20simply as buying and  selling gas and electricity in fact enron s view20is that it can  create a market for just about anything as if to underscore20that point  the company announced last year that it would begin trading20excess  broadband capacity20but describing what enron does isn t easy because what it does is 20mindnumbingly complex ceo jeff skilling calls enron a logistics  company20that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and  figures

david.w.delainey@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,tim my understanding is that partnership fee the 110m has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups mcconville and ondarza  as you are aware i sued them for breach  the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts  it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop   the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated  it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining unamortized fee of 18m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liabilitylets discussregardsdelainey forwarded by david w delaineyhouect on 06162000 0700 pm       from  tim belden                           06162000 0509 pm to wes colwellhouectect david w delaineyhouectect john j lavoratocorpenroncc paula harrishouectect subject fort james amortizationedith cross and i looked at the fort james deal in great detail in early 1999  when the deal was closed west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about 11 million  this money has already liquidated from our book  in fact i have a copy of the 33197 dpr that reflects this liquidation  at that time west power trading also paid a 350k credit reserve 247k to the finance book and 13 million in origination  i have also heard about a partnership fee that enron paid to fort james around the same time  i m not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it  it had nothing to do with the west power trading bookon john s recommendation i called wes to see if we could figure this out  wes please give me a call back to discuss  i think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from march of 1997 to see why an expense of 11 million was deferredthis is not my problem  i should not receive this expense  until this is resolved i would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power trading s expenses

i wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis  as you know we have issues in canada about taking cash collateral which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by peter previously see his emails of march 20 2001  however as opposed to cash it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of instruments  under such legislation as peter has indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral  therefore at first blush it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold lcs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in canadathere are a few concerns which i think are raised by your questions  the first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place  the personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral  therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with lcs  that is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty  we would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arosethe requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable  in other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance  this is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at allthe final point i would make is also raised by your second question below  my understanding is that the law in canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued  i believe that there may have been some recent ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount  however we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral  i do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as i believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocableif we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral i would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such use  since stikeman elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash collateral i would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these points as well  please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside counsel to proceedthanksgregfrom mark taylor on 04032001 0905 am cdtto peter keohanecalectectcc brent hendrynaenronenron carol st clairhouectect chris gaffneytorectect greg johnstoncalectect mark powellcalectect

great idea  a couple of questionscan we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest  if not can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there  in the us

security interest in an instrument can be perfected by possession under the personal property security act and an instrument includes a bank draft  if counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide lcs we could rely on perfection by possession  is this something we should investigate further  peter

susan.scott@enron.com,steven.harris@enron.com|jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,on november 2 2000 the california puc issued an order instituting investigation into the adequacy of sempra s socal s and sdge s planning of socal s and sdge s gas transmission system and what measures should be taken to correct any deficiencies  the parties have been ordered to appear and show cause at a hearing to be scheduled by the assigned alj demonstrating that  sdge has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 20002001 winter heating season as well as the longer term throughout the year  if such supply is not adequate sdge shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate supply  sdge s gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need for gasfired electric generation  if not sdge shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply  sdge s  gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by interests of its corporate affiliates  recently added demands on sdge s capacity are not negatively impacting supply for sdge s customers and are otherwise consistent with representations to the commission  sdge s current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable if not sdge shall propose changes a written response from the three parties on these issues is due on november 22  other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the response is filed the commission also ordered sdge to evaluate whether an interim interruptible program which will provide cost incentives to those customers voluntarily electing interruptible service is needed this winter  if so sdge must submit a proposal for expedited commission consideration the oii represents the commission s response to an advice letter filed by sdge requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric generation customers  the advice letter was heavily protested and was withdrawn by sdge in my conversation with mark baldwin regarding our pending consulting agreement for monitoring california regulatory matters for transwestern i asked him to watch for sempra s nov 22 filing and to advise whether he believes transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is to be scheduled  i will follow up with mark and provide you with a copy of the filing

susan.scott@enron.com,lorraine.lindberg@enron.com|lindy.donoho@enron.com|steven.harris@enron.com|steven.harris@enron.com,as you know current firm contracts on transwestern provide for delivery of 250 mmcfd of gas to topock  in the context of the gallup expansion transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 mmcfd to topock  once the gallup expansion is built transwestern will have a total of 290 mmcfd of firm capacity under contract to the topock delivery point  40 mmcfd more than pge has agreed to accept while pcbs continue to be presentbill cordes has asked what transwestern s potential liability to shippers would be if pge s refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes transwestern to have to curtail firm service at pgetopock  the legal answer is that transwestern s tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper  more specifically rate schedule fts1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper  in december january february july and august the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered  in all other months the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75 of nominatedconfirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days the tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from transwestern s failure to provide service under an fts1 contract  a shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge including for example the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper s inability to fulfill contractual obligations such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action  not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such pointsbill has asked steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure  i could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages  can we meet briefly to discuss this  i m available after the gallup meeting tomorrow am or after lunch on fridayor we can discuss a meeting time for next week  thank you

at enron through the world economic  development congress where we brought together ministers of finance and oil  immediately prior to the imfworld bank meeting infrastructureworld of which i am cofounder and vice chairman has recently  received 10 million each in funding from the ifc division of the world bank and  bechtel globalcashexchange is a separate but related business we have the  plan the experienced management team and proven technology and we will be  selecting major financial institution as a partner at the request of our corporate cfos we are developing an internet based  exchange for foreign exchange shortterm cash and credit that could give enron  a powerful product to sell to corporations worldwide i have attached and  executive summary and a business plan i would like to discuss this with you at  your earliest conveniencemajor sources of trade development and investment friction and inefficiency  in large developing countries in particular include the facilitation of foreign  exchange short term cash credit and working capital transactions this is a  source of high cost and frustration even for major global corporations and for  middle and smaller corporations these are even greater burdens today there are  no reliable and continuous flowing price sources for softer currencies as there  are for hard currencies even the larger soft currencies like the real or rupee  are quoted only 3 to 4 times a day on reuters and the only spot quotes are  available from traders who are motivated to benefit from a large spread the  globalcashexchange will allow buyers to transact at the middle of the interbank  spread there are lots of internet based foreign exchanges and none that i have  actually seen support buyer to buyer transactionsglobalcashexchange will develop an internet based exchange for foreign  exchange short term cash and credit the goal is to reduce costs of such  transactions global cash exchange can also greatly enhance capital formation  and the formation of local capital markets in developing countries this is a  large and complex undertaking where we will need to be partnering with one or a  group of major financial institutions like citibank cantor fitzgerald state  street bank schwab and the world bank as you know the foreign exchange fx market is the largest and most  participated financial market in the world with over 15 trillion exchanges  daily throughout the world there is no central market place for fx  transactions all fx transactions are conducted through a network of banks  dealers and brokers approximately 23 of fx transactions involve banks dealing  directly with each other the potential market for short term cash and credit  which will ultimately reduce the need for foreign exchange transactions  is  even largerwe are funding this internally and are starting to develop outside investor  support we have established great partnerships with organizations such as  standard  poor s and medley global advisors  httpwwwmedleyadvisorscom for ratings and content on the site vmac a  division of fsa that has patented the concept of providing pooled credit  enhancement facilities httpwwwfsacom for revolving credit enhancement  facilities and gen3partners httpwwwgen3partnerscom for strategic and  technological advice transactions that cannot be matched can be cleared through  deerhurst a leading foreign exchange fund manager who has agreed to provide  liquidity from day one we also know that we can purchase insurance for around  7 billion of annual transactions for just under 1m a year gcx is now at a  point that it has answered most of the questions that we had we have a  commitment from ashton technologies for full build out of sec approved  technology in exchange for equity this technology has been used successfully  for more complex securities transactions and allows for many equity market  facilities that forex markets do not currently have such as reserve book limit  order and so forth a description of the ashton technology and an executive  summary that we use for our corporate clients are attached we have good corporate support through world

support a 29billion bond financing by edison but would have prevented edison from usingthe funds to pay generators px and iso invoices directly or indirectlythe 29 billion could be used to pay qfs

2001 riordan and freeman s feud erupts in public power each questions the other s role in keeping the city free of california s energy crisis by michael finnegan terence monmaney times staff writerswith california mired in energy troubles mayor richard riordan and his former power chief s david freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of los angeles no rate hikes and no blackouts yet riordan and freeman have sullied their mutual success story by waging bitter campaigns to discredit each otherat first behind the scenes but now in public pettiness ingratitude conflicts of interest overblown claims of achievement such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to have good reason to pat each other on the back to freeman who has resigned as general manager of the la department of water and power to become chief energy advisor to gov gray davis it seems riordan resents his highprofile role in trying to steer california out of the energy crisis so the mayor freeman charged has elbowed his way into energy issues that he is illequipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could harm the environment with all due respect i have 25 years of experience and knowledgeand he has 25 days freeman said but he s the mayor and he didn t like it that i didn t just say yes to everything he came up with to riordan freeman s efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in los angeles the mayor said freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis and he scoffed at freeman for saying he had lifted morale at dwp morale was terrible under him riordan said i mean they are so relieved right now the backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos city councilwoman ruth galanter sees riordan and freeman as proud successful men unable to say i couldn t have done it without x y and z each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss she said much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings and the mayor a republican multimillionaire has taken pains to play down his dispute with freeman a liberal democrat from tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a southern drawl in an interview after his resignation freeman laid out the conflict point by point often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor one of his concerns freeman said was that riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agency s progress in protecting the environment freeman cited riordan s plans concerning coalfired power plants in nevada and utah that are partly controlled by the dwp the nation s largest municipal utility the first is the mohave generating station in laughlin nev a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the grand canyon the dwp had planned to sell its stake in the plant but freeman said riordan ordered him to back out of the sale he described the mayor s move as a sign that riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees dwp were completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the west i ve worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the dwp policy freeman said and i am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we ve made the other plant is part of the intermountain power project in central utah riordan has proposed building a new coalfired generating unit there but freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause in both cases riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of los angeles at an affordable cost by keeping its share of the mohave plant and expanding the utah plant los angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gasand the sharp rise in ratepayers  bills that would follow riordan said natural gas which provides 26 of the fuel for dwp plants causes less air pollution than coal which provides 51 the rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric los angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the dwp relies less on natural gas than most other california power providers i favor clean air and more natural gas but not to the point where we re going to destroy the economy of los angeles riordan said on the mohave plant riordan questioned the benefit of selling the city s share to a buyer that would simply continue running it it s still going to be coaldriven he said how does selling it help the environment the tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened with the charismatic dwp chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how la has dodged the crisis riordan and the dwp commissioners began to view him as too big for my britches freeman said the conflict reached its peak on april 17 the day freeman resigned to become the governor s advisor the dwp board president kenneth t lombard said the mayor told commissioners that day that it made the most sense to release him immediately all we were doing frankly was release him from his responsibilities and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us lombard said from riordan s standpoint freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest the city utility sells surplus power to the state so freeman would be on both sides of the sales freeman who had voluntarily bowed out of a dwp meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day was outraged at his sudden release in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees in an interview he called the conflict of interest assertion complete malarkey the insinuation that i have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of los angeles is bordering on slanderous considering what i ve accomplished here he said brian d arcy who heads the union local that represents 6000 dwp employees agreed that riordan and his commissioners kind of ran him out of here for david to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdydo is absolutely tacky d arcy said riordan said freeman deserves an aplus for his work at dwp the mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that freeman had done to hurt los angeles but he added when you have a conflict of interest you have to act before anything happens freeman has long bridled at the oversight of dwp not just by the mayor but by the agency s board and the city council in 1998 he called for city charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors the proposal went nowhere freeman s concerns were echoed in a report to be released monday the rand enterprise analysis report was commissioned by the dwp it calls for restructuring dwp management much the way freeman proposed but riordan and galanter who chairs the council s commerce energy and natural resources committee rejected the concept copyright 2001 los angeles times

reasonable certain period of time  the terms of the settlement agreement include edison will apply cash on hand plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs to paying off its back debt  the puc and edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt edison had at august 31 2001 less the cash on hand on that date less an additional 300 million adjustment  the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be 3 billion as of the end of this month  the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003 or on the full payment of its debt if sooner  if edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003 the commission retains the discretion to determine whether edison will pay a dividend in 2004  edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005 since edison s annual dividend has typically been about 400 million edison s shareholders will have forgone at least 12 billion in dividends and possibly more in addition to the 300 million adjustment edison will apply 100 of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt  edison commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers the puc can direct edison to use 150 million each year for other utility purposes including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies which would otherwise be used to pay down the edison debt  the puc agrees not to lower edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered  however rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate to enable edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003  there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over edison nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities edison may make up to 900 million in capital expenditures annuallythis settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california said loretta lynch president of the puc  the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayersthis agreement settles a november 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by edison against the puc in which edison claimed that the commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property  under this agreement edison will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commission s decisions implementing ab 1x ab 6x and the turn accounting proposal original messagefrom  dasovich jeff  sent tuesday october 02 2001 442 pmto dasovich

s past due accounts the socalled undercollectionif edison collects the 33b prior to 2003 then rates can changeif edison has not collected the 33 b by the end of 2003 the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder  half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the 33 b undercollectionedison can keep 10 of any refunds received after the 33b is paid offedison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the 33bedison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price riskedison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ie if dwr s costs go up the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison s

intensify considerablyit remains unclear how californiadwr will pay for the 125 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several monthsunder the structure devised by davis the revenues flowing from the cpucdwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since januaryin short there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bondssafe to say that today s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis and left his approach to solving california electricity crisis in shambleswhat nexta broad leftright coalition of energy interests supported a bill

bill is silent however on how california would pay for the dwr contracts and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a resultall four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill  the leftright coalition from nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get davis to sign itdavis has said that he will veto the bill

note marked increase in chron s quality of reporting when it ain t lazarus doing the reporting  this was the lead front page story in the chron  note abraham s quote in p3 re must increase supply or decrease demand  i ve heard that somewhere beforebestjeffenergy boss says state summer blackouts  appear inevitable  carolyn lochhead chronicle washington bureaufriday march 16 2001 2001 san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifchroniclearchive20010316mn200965dtl washington  the bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts appear inevitable in california this summer but it firmly rebuffed a deal from sen dianne feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices energy secretary spencer abraham insisted that price controls would make shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state the administration s top priority is to prevent blackouts he said let me make one point clear abraham told the senate energy and natural resources committee any action we take must either help increase supply or reduce demand    price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand in fact in our view they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis abraham said electricity shortages in california will get worse and blackouts this summer appear inevitable he cited projections of anywhere from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer i m not saying that people in california don t want lower energy costs he said but i know for sure they don t want to be sitting this summer without electricity at all and our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary public interest responsibility of this administration feinstein became the first leading state democrat to break with gov gray davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity prices low for california consumers even as soaring wholesale costs have driven the state s investorowned utilities to bankruptcy and now are draining the state s budget surplus but feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation saying that if people just turned off their computers at night they would save 7 percent of the state s electricity supply she also said the state which now is buying electricity for the utilities has already run through 27 billion and could spend 10 billion on electricity this year that is gone feinstein said it doesn t buy a school it doesn t repair a road it doesn t build the water system many of us believe the state needs the offer came as a compromise with oregon republican sen gordon smith who warned that an economic and environmental catastrophe awaits the western states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a drought in the northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power smith s move to embrace price controls which he had earlier rejected reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the bush administration to intervene in the electricity market as western officials complained bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now threaten the region s economy lessons of supply demandi m afraid this summer we re going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers the lessons of supply and demand said smith whose family owns a frozen vegetables business i don t want to send the wrong signals to the marketplace    but i ll tell you the wrong signal is a recession abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the bush administration is not doing enough to aid the west citing a letter he sent to davis yesterday that said the white house will not oppose the state s plan to take over the investorowned utilities  transmission lines despite disagreeing with the approach regrettably i think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some to suggest that the administration either does not care about california and the west or is doing nothing to help abraham said that is simply untrue abraham said the federal energy regulatory commission s recent order to 13 power suppliers to refund 69 million in january overcharges to the utilities would send a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren t going to get away with it he also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and discussions with mexico to try to increase electricity exports from baja to california but abraham firmly rejected price caps saying they have already been tried and already failed in california when a price ceiling for electricity sales into the state was reduced over the past year from 750 a megawatt hour to 150 results of price capsthe lower the price cap was set the higher average electricity prices rose abraham said in part because municipal utilities were exempt new federal price caps would affect just half of the western electricity market he said and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets rather than control prices he also said price caps would almost certainly reduce sales from mexico and canada and induce cheating and circumvention armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year feinstein expressed her strong disappointment oh mr secretary feinstein said i was really surprised by the ideologic hardness of your statement i must tell you that she said california will be 5000 megawatts short of electricity this summer enough power for 5 million homes it s a lot of shortness she said predicting that prices will reach 5000 a megawatt hour what does california do about that if it isn t going to get any help to provide that stability and reliability over that period of time    all we re asking for is help to prevent pricegouging abraham countered that the administration s position is common sense i m telling you i think this summer if california has worse blackouts than currently projected that price caps would have been a disservice to the people of your state abraham said if the rest of the west finds the canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of price caps    that s in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our public responsibilities here in sacramento davis said he was particularly grateful for the administration s promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover he also said the state would have just enough power to avoid blackouts but said federal officials are of a different view still the governor continued to urge   some effort to temper wholesale prices email carolyn

21 2001 0221 pm text los angeles dow jonescalifornia state controller kathleen connell wednesday said the state s general fund surplus has dropped to 32 billion from 85 billion in january mostly because of electricity purchases made by the state s department of water resources a press release saidconnell also denied gov gray davis  request to transfer an additional 56 billion from the general fund to the special fund for economic uncertainties the release saidconnell noted that given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power purchases the state would need to borrow 24 billion in order to tranfer the 56 billion from the general fund to the special fundwe started this year with a generous budget surplus the energy crisis has taken much of that away and this transfer on top of the electricity purchases would put the fund at risk connell said connell called on davis to ensure that the cdwr completes by the end of may 2001 the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the general fundshe also asked that the cdwr notify her of all power purchases made and contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of any purchases and contracts negotiated in the futureconnell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys that exceed 55 million and asked that the department of finance be directed to prepare new

republicans led by assemblymember tony strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against governor davis state controller kathleen connell the department of water resources dwr and dwr director thomas hannigan   this event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters  assembly republicans present were assem phil wyman assem dennis mountjoy assem dave cogdill assem keith richman assem john campbell  also present was chuck bell attorney at law representing assembly republicans in the suit to obtain the state s energy purchase information  strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the department of general services dwr state controller kathleen connell and the department of finance in the last month  these letters were signed by several assembly republicans including the newly chosen minority leader dave cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by dwr   these letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the governor  also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of assembly republicans in the superior court of san diego in their suit  strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band governor davis and the merchant generators  he added on february 16 the governor said he could solve this problem in 20 minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved    referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in san diego superior court strickland said the republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators he added we had no choice but to legally compel the governor to release this vital information  assem phil wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the legislature have to join with the association of broadcasters to get basic information  wyman added that he doesn t have enough information to support certain bills because he doesn t know if there is money available  on the subject of tuesday s decision by the puc to allow a rate increase assem mountjoy said he believes the governor and the puc are completely connected adding this is the governor s puc he pulls the strings there  this rate increase will impact all californians said assem keith richman we will all have to pay for the governor and the governor s puc s lack of action last fall when richman said the republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue  assem john campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyou re gonna crash  when asked who is paying for this lawsuit assem strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills  attorney chuck bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a may 18 hearing date  bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week  when asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied

17 reuters  enron corp moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses but the energy giant still has a way to go to make wall street happy analysts said wednesday enron north america s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on tuesday the company took 101 billion in charges and writedowns on illfated investments measures enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable withubs warburg analyst ronald barone said on wednesday he was not thrilled by the announcement during a conference call to discuss thirdquarter earnings and for good reason moody s investors service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of enron s longterm debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved barone said the writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company s operations went some way to appeasing wall street after a tumultuous year in which enron s stock lost about twothirds of its value but analysts said they were not about to let enron off the hook just yet bear stearns analyst robert winters said he remained concerned about enron s quality of earnings and cash flow winters said he believed enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk which could adversely affect some of the company s financing arrangements problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain particularly overseas he said one such asset is enron s 65 percent stake

english news servicec reuters limited 2001new york oct 17 reuters  energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the us northeast hinges in part on setting up a northeast regional transmission organization rto rtos are predominantly forprofit groups established to bring all of a region s highvoltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the gridthe federal energy regulatory commission ferc which oversees the interstate wholesale power market believes rtos will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers in turn improving service and driving down rates if ferc can drive the northeast rto to closure in a reasonable period of time it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation enron corp s managing director of global government affairs rick shapiro told reuters houstonbased enron is the nation s top energy marketer how and when the rto gets implemented will radically impact the market it s crucial to the development of the market in new england mirant corp spokesman ray long told reuters energy provider mirant of atlanta has 1400 megawatts mw of generation in new england the company is currently adding another 700 mw to its canal station in massachusetts once we get the permits for canal we will reassess whether to proceed with the project a big part of that assessment will depend on the rto process long said the northeast rto ferc wants to see four superregional rtos created in the us  in the northeast midwest southeast and west several regions have taken long strides toward developing rtos including a notforprofit model proposed in the midwest and rival forprofit plans vying for ferc approval in the west ferc chairman patrick wood seeking to spur the development of rtos favors giving utilities until dec 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market though the commission has not voted on this plan the northeast rto will include new england new york the pennsylvanianew jerseymaryland pjm region and possibly parts of eastern canada ferc said it wants the northeast rto to be built on the pjm market platform and to include the best practices of the new england and new york markets pjm interconnection which operates the power grid in parts of pennsylvania new jersey maryland delaware virginia and washington dc is the nation s only fully functioning rto the process ferc set in place to establish one rto in pjm new york and new england is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market long said long said mirant determined a single northeast rto would save more than 440 million annually by eliminating the artificial borders that now exist between new york new england and pjm an administrative law judge acting as a mediator for ferc considered three proposals for creating the northeast rto the three plans were proposed by interested parties including mirant and enron and the region s grid operators  the new york independent system operator iso in new york iso new england in new england and pjm last month the judge asked the ferc to decide who will govern the northeast rto and what the timetable is to put the plan in place the judge favored a plan put forward by the new york iso and iso new england if ferc implements the rto plan proposed by pjm in 2003 consumers could save 15 billion  440 million a year  over the new yorknew england plan which would not be implemented until 2006 long said under the pjm plan pjm would overlay its current market model across the entire region while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets

because the american gas association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year enron would like to see another organization take over the report said john lavorato president and chief executive of the company s americas wholesale services unitspeaking at a meeting with analysts lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals without a regular report on storage gas inventory the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past he said the department of energy s energy information administration publishes monthly data on gas storage but the information isn t as timely as data the aga reports each wednesday the eia issued its latest gas storage report oct 9 it showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of july the data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities it also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of august and september those estimates are generated by a computer model wednesday s weekly storage report from the aga will show estimated inventory as of oct 12 the aga estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities that data is then run through an aga computer model to generate the report lavorato said he would like to see the eia the interstate natural gas association of america or consultants like pira energy group an international energy consulting firm take over reports on storage inventory ingaa is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the us canada and mexico they manage many of the gas storage facilities lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited he said he said he thinks the aga has found itself in the middle of something it didn t want to be in originally intended for use within the gas industry the weekly aga report has become highprofile and is even watched by equity markets he said some industry participants have criticized the aga report wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the aga many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures

termination notice on dpcin a retaliatory action mseb has slapped a legal notice on dabhol power company to cancel the power purchase agreement the board will file a case with the state electricity regulatory commission on friday a retaliation to dpc s may 19 preliminary termination notice mseb had with this notice legally questioned the validity of the entire ppa state government sources said here mseb chief vinay bansal confirmed the development and said the notice was served on thursday rescinding the ppa and accordingly setting it aside under law we are saying that as per the indian contract s act 1872 mseb wishes to consider the entire contract with dpc as void sources said the legal notice for cancellation of the ppa comes in the wake of dpc s failure to achieve 100 per cent peak load capacity in 180 minutes from a cold start20we do not need to send a preliminary termination notice this trumpcard of ours has entitled us to terminate the ppa they said under the ppa dpc had made a representation that its power plant will conform to certain dynamic characteristics and operations which it has time and again failed to comply with the sources added the sources said dpc had in several letters to mseb and the state government admitted that the multinational could not ramp up generation as it was a baseload power station and not a peak one as per the indian contracts act of 1872 such a confession amounts to material misrepresentation of facts which in this case has been knowingly committed by dpc the sources said on may 19 2001 dpc had issued a ptn to mseb after months of working with the lossmaking board the state government and the centre to find solutions saying it was apparent that the first two parties are unwilling to honour their offtake commitments for the entire 2184mw power station  the centre has clearly communicated its unwillingness to assist mseb and maharashtra in either buying power or providing credit support dpc addedthe financial express friday may 25 2001mseb slaps notice revoking dabhol ppa   sanjay jogthe maharashtra state electricity board mseb in a retaliatory move on thursday slapped an avoidance notice under the provisions of the indian contracts act on the dabhol power company dpc for material misrepresentation  we are now convinced that your conduct is not bonafide and as such we are constrained to avoidrescind the power purchase agreement dated december 8 1993 with immediate effect  mseb chairman vinay bansal said in a strongly  worded twopage notice to dpcmr bansal claimed the company had made material misrepresentation and our consent to the ppa was caused inter alia by the  representation on your part in respect of the capacity and capability of the dabhol power station in the circumstances we are advised that  the ppa is void andor is voidable at our optionhowever mseb said that it was agreeable to continue the present arrangement of purchase of power and payment till the disputes were resolved by the appropriate forum so as to minimise loss and inconvenience for such  supply we are prepared to make payments to  you to as provided for under the ppa but such  payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable   compensation by a competent forum mseb addedthe mseb missive said at that all material times  the company represented that it would build   construct own maintain and operate a stateoftheart power station with a nominal baseload capacity of 670 mw having a start up and loading profile that would reach full load within 180 minutes from a cold start the   company also represented that the dabhol plant would have certain operating characteristics and   dynamic parameters  one of the key characteristic and parameters of the dabhol power station to be constructed in phase i of the project was that from a cold start the power plant would have the capacity to ramp up to 100 per cent load within a period of 180 minutes mseb said it further added that relying   upon the said express representation in respect of the operating characteristics and dynamic parameters of power station relating to attaining  full generation from a cold start mseb consented to the ppa since commissioning of the dabhol plant in may 1999 the company has been billing mseb for capacity payments based on the rated baseload capacity for each availability period  until january 2001 the operating characteristics and dynamic parameters of the power station in respect of the ramp up capacity in a cold start had never come into question and at no stage you disclosed to us any information in respect of the capability of the dabhol power station being materially different from the contractual parameters mentioned in the ppa mseb said further on january 28 2001 to its urgent requirement mseb instructed to deliver fully declared baseload of 657 mw within three hours you however failed to deliver the energy required by us and committed breach of the ppa you committed similar defaults on february 13 and march 29 in view of these defaults we became entitled to rebate as provided in the ppa in respect of the three occasions and claimed the same from you mseb addedmseb charged that the company however failed and neglected to compute the rebate or adjust the rebate in the billing statement or to pay the same to mseb in the letters addressed to us after january 28 you have admitted that your power plant does not conform to the ppa and is not capable of meeting the contractual terms in respect of the crucial operating characteristics and dynamic parameters in particular you have acknowledged and admitted that the actual performance and capability of the power station does not conform to the start up and loading profile curves of schedule 6 of the ppa mseb added20mseb said it has shown utmost restraint and has given more than sufficient opportunities to resolve the issues amicably instead of cooperating in the matter you have embarked on a campaign to create confusion and obfuscate the issues which has involved inter alia in wrongfully withholding rebate payments pressurising us to make payment that are not due invoking guarantee issued by the government of maharashtra and government of india invoking arbitration declaring political force majeure without justification wrongly seeking to activate the escrow arrangement without being entitled to do so and issuing preliminary termination notices on false and frivolous grounds it added   according to mseb in these circumstance it was now convinced that the company s conduct is not bonafide and it was constrained to avoidrescind the ppa with immediate effectthe hindu businessline friday may 25 2001dpcmseb row centre awaits negotiations20the centre is willing to consider any worthwhile idea emerging out of the negotiating committee for the settlement of the dispute between dabhol power and mseb according to the union power minister mr suresh prabhu an official release issued today states that any such proposal has to be acceptable to both the mseb as well as the dpc industry sources however point out that the centre s stated position is not likely to provide a breakthrough since the centre has endorsed a consensusdriven approach with its involvement restricted to the participation of its member mr av gokak in the negotiating committee a meeting between dabhol power company and ministry of power is slated to be  held on friday following dpc s request to the meet the power secretary mr ak basu20the financial express friday may 25 200120mseb has no right to revoke ppa says dpcthe dabhol power company dpc in its reaction said the maharashtra state electricity board did not have the right to rescind the power purchase agreement ppa as attempted in its notice   a dpc press release issued here on thursday said that it would appear that mseb s notice was a deliberate attempt to further delay the resolution of difficult issues confronting the mseb nevertheless even though the mseb continues to seek ways to delay and frustrate the resolution of these matters dpc remains open to receiving proposals from the board government of maharashtra and government of india  in the first place the ppa does not allow mseb to shut down the plant except in emergencies moreover the dabhol plant was intended as a baseload facility as a result the question of plant performance following a cold start should not arise the mseb has chosen an obscure and improper justification for attempting to rescind a contract that in any event was signed more than seven years ago in any case this basis and many of mseb s related claims are already the subject of a pending arbitration initiated by the dpc our arbitration notice of april 12 2001 should serve as evidence of our confidence in spc s legal position and we expect that the issues in arbitration will be resolved to our satisfaction the company addedthe financial express friday may 25 2001mseb issues rs 136crore cheque for power purchased from dpc for april  sanjay jogthe maharashtra state electricity board mseb which served an avoidance notice on thursday prepared a cheque of rs 136 crore towards power purchase from the dabhol power company dpc in april this year mseb sources told the financial express that the payment would be made under protest as the dpc has failed to pay the rebate of rs 401 crore charged by it for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 the cheque was prepared well before 5 pm however the dpc officials would collect it on friday may 25 the due date for the payment of bills mseb sources saidsources said that the mseb has taken a conscious decision to continue the power purchase and make payments to the dpc despite serving the avoidance notice mseb has so far paid the february bill of rs 114 crore and marchbill of rs 134 crore under protest mseb said that despite its instructions to maintain load at 657 mw from 6 pm onwards dpc was unable to pick up and is generating only 216 mwh at 645 pm on the appointed hour 6 pm 9 pm dpc s declared baseload capacity of 657 mw the company failed to deliver energy as instructed by the mseb and delivered only 156 mw on january 28 2001according to mseb a shortfall occurred and in terms of clause 84 b iii the available baseload  capacity was required to be calculated such shortfall was to be calculated on the basis of the formula set out therein for a period of 14 days prior to the available period in which the shortfall occurredmseb said that dpc owes nearly rs 143073 crore after adjusting the december bill rs 102 crore and january bill rs 111 crore mseb is entitled to damages for misrepresentation calculated from the date the power plant made its entry into commercial service andor mseb under section 19 of the contract act is entitled to treat the contract as void mseb said in failing to compute the rebate for the shortfall that occurred on january 28 in its billing statement of january dpc committed a breach of clause 111 b ii  mseb was thus entitled to adjust the rebate against the outstanding sum for the period relating to the january billing statementthe financial express friday may 25 2001mseb may file petition before merc today20the mseb is trying its level best to file a petition on friday before the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission merc for seeking its ruling over its dispute with dpc under the provisions of the electricity regulatory commission erc act 1998  mseb sources say a petition comprising annexures is being prepared in consultation with the battery of lawyers the petition will be made with an appeal to the merc to adjudicate the disputes  the dpc has committed a material misrepresentation and also misdeclared and defaulted on the  availability of power in january february and march although the ppa had been inked between the mseb and dpc before the establishment of merc the disputes have arisen after the merc was delegated powers to adjudicate disputes on december 5 2000 mseb sources said  as per the erc act provisions merc is in a position to admit the mseb s petition on the grounds that consumers are entitled for getting quality power at fair price the decision to take up the matter at the level of the merc is with an objective to shift the legal battle from london to the indian soil simultaneously it would also save cost  the mseb at length would explain its case visavis dpc s failure to honour the rebate and its payment  under the ppa dpc undertook to construct and operate a base load combined cycle power station in two phases mseb agreed to purchase and accept delivery of the electrical energy generated by the dabhol power station into its distribution system and pay for the electrical generating capacity made available to it as well as for the electrical energy actually delivered subject to the terms and conditions of the ppa in terms of clause 1 of the government of india guarantee dated september 15 1994 no sums of money are validly due by mseb to dpc and accordingly there has been no failure on the part of mseb to make such payments mseb saidbusiness standard friday may 25 2001merc pulls up mseb for not providing dpc papers to prayas renni abraham in mumbai20the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission merc on thursday pulled up the maharashtra state electricity board mseb for not having provided documents related to the dabhol power company dpc to prayas an ngo despite being ordered to do so in january chairman of merc p subrahmanyam said in the wake of the january order by the commission and in the light of the right of information act passed by the maharashtra legislature all documents apart from those listed by the government have to be made available to the public even the electricity regulatory commission act states that the such commissions like merc will act in a transparent manner hence we said that all the documents should be provided to prayas20the commission rapped mseb for not being able to explain with legal opinion how it could withhold the documents despite the merc ruling the commission has given the board a month to provide all documents to prayas as well as itself related to the dpc project  with regard to those documents it claims confidentiality the commission has sought a clear legal stand by it and not a reliance on merely the legal opinion forwarded by dpcwhen mseb has such a huge legal department at its disposal it s reliance on dpc s legal opinion is not reasonable the commission held another rider posed by the merc was that while all costs effected by mseb s contractual agreements with dpc were passed on to consumers why the consumer was not allowed to see the documents related to the ppasources added that containing the fuel cost charges will reduce tariffs and make the project conducive to higher offtake of powerthe indian

on the issue in a press statement released here dr pachauri has contended mr godbole s statement that the committee has also suggested that the judicial enquiry headed by a service or a retired supreme court judge should be initiated as soon as possible   according to dr pachauri this statement needs to be seen in the context of the fact that three out of the five members in the committee recorded their strong dissent with this view can the view of two members of the committee clearly a minority be read as the committee has also suggested    dr pachauri has                      argued according to him can a judicial enquiry really force enron back to the negotiating table   in the press statement he has thrown up several other questions  can the maharashtra government renegotiate a deal with enron if a judicial enquiry is in progress and would the public accept any such deal till the enquiry is over and till it is over the maharashtra government would continue to run up huge

around the uncertainties in the naphtha prices we are working towards a rational tariff structure which will insulate it to some extent from the vagaries of fuel prices a top state government source told business standard the official indicated that this could take the form of reducing the passthrough component of fuel prices we could try to get a lower passthrough from the current 100 per cent he explained20alternatively the fuel component could be capped at a certain level to protect the tariff from surging fuel prices fuel prices are an important component in the20tariff structure as the entire component in variable costs is passed on to the purchaser crude oil prices which had touched a high of 33 per barrel last year20pushing up dpc s tariff had softened to 26 per barrel levels in

the 740 mw phasei of the project is currently naphthabased the entire plant is supposed to turn to lng once the 1444 mw phaseii comes into commercial operation naphtha and lng prices are both linked to crude oil prices dpc had earlier attributed the rise in tariff from the contracted price partly to the sharp rise in global naphtha pricesit had argued that the rise in naphtha prices coupled with the low offtake of power by the mseb was responsible for the higher tariffs20business standardfriday may 25 2001httpwwwbusinessstandardcomtodayopinion5aspgodbole report cea s dubious due diligencethe central electricity authority s role in scrutinising the technical aspects of the project is questionedthe  technoeconomic clearance tec  from cea has been a controversial issue the inprinciple clearance for dpc s project pursuant to sections 29 and 44 of the electricity supply act 1948 the act was issued by mseb on may 20 1993 the clearance was granted subject to clearance from the cea as required under20section 44 of the act on november 26 1993 cea granted its conditional clearance for the project after considering the technical aspects of the scheme at its20meeting held on november 12 1993 a day earlier on november 11 1993 the secretary ministry of power appears to have written to the cea and quoted an extract of the minutes of a foreign investment promotion board fipb meeting of november 5 1993 which said finance secretary has observed that the question of the cost of power has been looked into and it has been found that it was more or less in line with other projects being put up in maharashtra accordingly the cea observed that the aspects related to import of fuel foreign exchange rules and deviation from government of india tariff notification indicting return on equity have been examined by fipb and the project has been found acceptable by them20on july 14 1994 cea issued another clearance for the project stating that all the conditions had been complied with however it reiterated two conditions stipulated earlier viz  phase ii of the project could only be taken up after msebgom ensures absorption of the entire power including offpeak power in or outside maharashtra together with the completion of associated transmission system matching with the commissioning schedule of the project the cea as stated in an affidavit by the cea in the citu case considers this to be the technoeconomic clearance accorded to the scheme which was based on discussions in a meeting held on 24 june 1994 the minutes of this meeting are not available to the committee furthermore it is curious that the letter does not mention the word technoeconomic anywhere as compared to a clearance given to similar ipp independent power producer projects 20subsequently on december 23 1994 cea issued a letter to ministry of power stating that the cost of power has been found reasonable by the ministry of finance cea feels that since the cost of power is to be derived from the capital cost the capital cost of dabhol project may also be considered reasonable in effect the cea said that since the ministry of finance finds the tariff acceptable the capital cost is reasonable which accords greater significance to the role of the tariff in addition curiously enough it makes no reference to the meeting of 24th june 1994 regarding technoeconomic appraisal of dpc mentioned in the cea s affidavit thus it is moot question whether the cea discharged the statutory duty cast on it under the electricity supply act adequately20modification to the project after renegotiations subsequent to the negotiations conducted by the negotiating group  the cea received a letter from dpc dated20march 7 1996 intimating certain alterations to the dabhol project and stating that these alterations were minor as per the first proviso of section 32 of the electricity20supply act 1948  the state of maharashtra through goi government of india had sought cea s views in the matter the matter was deliberated upon by the cea and the goi was informed that increase in capacity of plant and use of naphtha in place of distillate fuel in phase i of the scheme were of minor character but the removal of lng facility from the scope of the scheme and execution of the same by a separate entity in phase ii of the scheme was of a major nature20subsequently dpc vide letter dated may 7 1996 informed cea that dpc was agreeable to implement the scheme without changes considered as major by cea20viz the removal of the lng facility from the project scheme as a result dpc and mseb went ahead with the project without hiving off the lng facilities and avoidedobtaining any fresh clearance required from cea it is difficult to comprehend how mseb agreed to accept the reintegration of the lng facility which was not in its20own interest  the committee finds it inexplicable why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from 2828 million to 2501 million as20agreed to by dpc as mentioned in the summary report of the renegotiating group which appears to have been intimated to cea as part of its economic appraisal20neither is there any intimation about the change in the cost of power due to the renegotiation of tariff which formed the basis for cea consideration that the capital20cost of dabhol project is reasonable the counteraffidavit by cea on july 1 1996 in the citu case however states that since no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearancewas not necessary this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea did not consider the economic aspects of the20project at all indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 1994 with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 1994 the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all 20demand for power as already mentioned the gom s submission at the start of the project regarding the need for power was flawed to the extent that it failed to20distinguish between different types of load this led to an inappropriately high plf of 90 being taken for purposes of calculating per unit tariff in 1993 however20based on the past growth of consumption and load it was possible to argue that a 695 mw plant could be absorbed into the system this however completely20omitted any consideration as to whether there was a demand for power at the price that was expected to be charged by dpc20the subsequent error of calculation however this mistake pales in comparison to the assurance given by mseb on september 2 1998 that there was sufficient20demand to absorb the power from phase ii as mentioned earlier the cea clearance to dpc stipulated that phase ii of the project could only be taken up after20msebgom ensures absorption of the entire power including offpeak power in or outside maharashtra together with the completion of associated transmission20system matching with the commissioning schedule of the project in response to a letter from dpc on the demand supply position in the mseb system mseb20replied establishing that there was sufficient demand 20the initial error of composition the mseb demand projections for justifying the requirement of dabhol was on the basis of the 15th eps the actual consumption20in 1998 was higher than the estimate in the 15th eps by 44 mseb therefore replaced the base year eps estimate with the higher actual consumption and20applied the eps growth rates to this higher base on the face of it perhaps justifiable until one looks at the growth of demand in the past  the actual growth20in demand in the mseb system in the years immediately before 1998 were actually much lower than the 15th eps estimates indeed there is a sharp slowdown20in growth in 1996 this slowdown was completely ignored while the actual consumption in 1998 was indeed about 46 higher than estimated by 15th eps the20trend growth rate was actually much lower 2 in 1997 and 5 in 1998 as compared to the growth of 2 and 5 in the previous two years mseb estimated an20immediate return to earlier growth rates of 8 to 9 20based on these extremely overoptimistic assumptions mseb stated there is sufficient projected base load demand for power in the state to justify phase ii of20the dabhol project even at a 90 dispatch this was stated without an analysis of the load curve indeed mseb in its projections before the committee has20submitted that their current expectations are that consumption in 20042005 will be around 67813 mu as opposed to 91202 mu expected by them in 199820implying an overestimation of 58 on the basis of this unconvincing estimation of demand  phase ii of dpc was given the go ahead20the world bank was asked to review the project by goi for possible financing it reviewed the project extensively and pointed out on april 30 1993 that the project was not a leastcost choice for base load power generation compared to indian coal and local gas even if domestic fuels were not available20imported coal would be the leastcost option for baseload generation for mseb with current environmental standards the unique features of this lngbased20projectoffset lng s environmental benefits over coal 20the current design which would dispatch the plant as a base load unit at 8085 minimum plant factorwould prevent the operational flexibility of a combined20cycle plant andthe project would add more capacity than needed to meet the projected load growth in 1998 and would also result in uneconomic plant dispatchin addition substantial adjustment in electricity tariffs would be required to recover the cost of the project from the consumers and to safeguard mseb s financial positionadjustments limited to special industrial categories would not be sufficient as their capability to continue to crosssubsidize by paying more than the already high cost of lng power would be limited20subsequently after further discussions the world bank wrote again on july 26 1993 to reconfirm their earlier conclusion and stress that the project needed to20be reshaped to serve highervalue intermediate load and that if the project was being justified on the basis that the existing system was projected to decline in20efficiency and most recently discovered slippages in mseb s ongoing and planned leastcost program then it was better to take determined actionsto20reverse this projected deterioration rather than accepting it as a given fact in the analysis of new investments20enron was concerned it wrote to mseb stating  i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed we will engage a pr firm during the next trip and hopefully20manage the media from here on the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington we will get there we need now to put the ppa behind us emphasis added mseb and gom addressed these objections of the world bank by emphasising the environmental benefits of gas reducing the plant sizeand assuring the goi that there would be power sector reform to adjust electricity tariffs 20in retrospect all the concerns of the world bank proved well founded reform did not occur the cost was too expensive and the system has not been able to20absorb the capacity even of phasei in hindsight it is always easy to argue that the decisions made at that time were not justified but in this case these issues20were raised and dismissed at the time the original decision was madethe economic times friday may 25 200120will the lights go out on

additional project cost only if the renegotiations look like making any headway with epc contractor bechtel stopping construction at dabhol indian lenders are fearing a further cost overrun it could be around 20 million per month if the project is delayed for a few months the financial viability of the project will be at stake said senior financial institution officials they said the huge cost overrun had become a major deterrent in completion of phase ii when domestic lenders refused take any further exposure in the controversial project enron had scouted for foreign debt but in vain indian lenders who contributed 40 per cent of 29 billion earlier project cost had earlier refused to take more exposure later foreign lenders have also                                           taken a negative stand said sources20according to fi sources enron wanted to maintain status quo in the debtequity ratio at 7030 this would mean an additional debt of 280 million and an equity call of 120 million with the minority stakeholders  mseb and bechtel they hold 15 per cent and 10 per cent respectively  having                                           shown their dissent in the project a new equity infusion  has turned almost impossible in this situation enron will have to raise its stake from the current level of 65 per cent this is an unlikely scenario since enron is actually planning to reduce its stake in the project to below 50 per cent said an enron official enron is in a fix now the entire responsibility of bringing in the additional cost lies on the shoulders of enron it could bring the fund in the form of equity quasi equity or                                           debt or a mix debtequity said an industry analyst cost overrun has stemmed from devaluation of rupee visavis dollar and increase in equipment cost indian fis are now wary of a further cost overrun due to delay in project execution20according to the ppa the ptn would mean fixing up a deadline of six months for pulling the final plug on the project as of now the fis have held back 250 million debt to the project after the ptn is served dpc could not expect lenders to make any more disbursements and it has almost sealed the fate of the project said an fi source while the 740mw phase i is operational the second phase of 1144 mw was expected to go fully operational by the yearend

pawar madhav godbole has decided to stay on with the committee that will renegotiate the deal that the dabhol power company has with the maharashtra state electricity board thank goodness for that for many years india needed something like the report filed by the committee headed by mr godbole the enron project has been dogged by controversy allegations of goldplating and graft the initial power purchase agreement ppa signed in 1993 when the congress government of sharad pawar ruled maharashtra was attacked by the opposition which included the bjp and shiv sena when a senabjp coalition came to power it scrapped the deal only to sign another one in 1995 then the socalled renegotiation  was widely perceived to have been an eyewash that allowed everybody to save face but push the project through20one year later the only thing cleared by the first 13day vajpayee government in new delhi was a counter guarantee for the project five years later the same allegations are flying thick and fast given that godbole should stick around to finish a job that needs to be done the report of the committee headed by him points out serious flaws in the way the project was cleared in the terms that successive governments in maharashtra and new delhi agreed to and in project specifics if this is correct a handful of babus mantris and managers have been taking the indian public for a ride and profiting at everybody else s expense20that has to stop the terms under which the project functions have to be renegotiated yes there are serious problems with ipps trying to sell power to bankrupt state utilities those problems have to be resolved by quick reforms meanwhile there is no reason why india should put up with                                           irregularities pointed out in

prime minister rajiv gandhi s camelot and began shaping policy setting the stage for the economic reforms introduced in 1991 over the past two decades dr ahluwalia has pushed economic liberalisation sometimes as a general on a battlefield with his army of fellow travellers in different economic ministries and sometimes like a guerrilla using unexpected opportunities to plant an idea into a prime minister s mind through well thought out strategy and clever tactics dr ahluwalia has left a mark on economic policy making in india after two decades in government he moves on to the international monetary fund where he will head an independent evaluation office evaluating the fund s policies on a reported us150000 annual salary dr  ahluwalia is not yet calling it quits to policy making in india but agreed to give an  exit interview  to the financial express20you joined the government as an economic advisor in 1980 and have been closely associated with   economic policy making for two decades now the indian economy had registered an annual average rate of growth of 35 between 1950 and 1980 and since 1980 it has recorded a 55 to 60 rate of growth   was this acceleration of growth built on the foundations of what had been achieved in the first phase or would you take credit for your policies of economic liberalisation and trade openness in the second phase20i certainly would not claim that the acceleration in growth was due to my being there individuals play a relatively small part in the larger scheme of things i have no doubt that the policy changes which began in the mid1980s but were really accelerated after 1991 are major factors explaining the improved performance in the last two decades in the 1980s the government recognised the limitations of the earlier control regime but changes were marginal the controls remained in place but they were operated more flexibly the 1991 changes were much bolder they were based on a clear recognition of the need for a system change it was recognised that the economy would benefit from much greater freedom and the unleashing of competition and unshackling of entrepreneurial energywhile 1991 did constitute a policy break and there was an acceleration of growth in 199396 the longterm rate of growth of 19812001 has refused to rise above 60 so have the post91 reforms failed to deliver higher growthwe had a sharp acceleration of growth in the mid1990s with three years of 75 growth in 199495 to   199697 since then it is true that growth has slowed down this deceleration is worrying and needs to be   reversed i must mention however that although the average growth in the 1990s may not look much better  than in the 1980s there is in fact a significant difference between the two decades in the 1980s growth was fuelled by an unsustainable buildup of debt internal and external in the 1990s the external position has actually improved over the decade we have a current account deficit which is quite modest in my view if anything it is too small in terms of debt service ratios we are now in a very comfortable position 20 while the external profile of the economy has certainly improved in the 1990s the internal fiscal profile is back where it was in the beginning of the 1990s and growth has slowed downthat is undoubtedly a major source of weakness at present there are many respects in which the economy is stronger than at the beginning of the 1990s let me mention four first freeing up the economy from the   draconian and hugely inefficient external sector controls has contributed to efficiency and created selfconfidence in external economic management we now know we don t need the extensive and highly   inefficient foreign exchange controls and import controls we had earlier to manage the economy we would  never have developed an infosys or a wipro if we had not changed these external sector controls20second the unleashing of competition in industry has strengthened indian industry industry circles often   show signs of nervousness and this is understandable given the nature of change but by and large i would   say indian business is gearing itself up for competition it may be a little too slow but the process is   underway every industrialist may not survive in the new competitive world and this is an important cause of  nervousness but the objective cannot be that every industrialist will do well only that indian industry as a group will do well i think that will happen with the right policiesthird liberalisation of controls by the centre has given the states new degrees of flexibility for attracting   investment both domestic and foreign some of the states have done very well with growth rates comparable with the best in the world the negative side of course is that the weaker performing states have seen a deterioration in their growth however there is now a much greater realisation in these states that much of the problem lies with their internal policies and they must take steps to improve their performance herein lies the real hope for higher growth for the country as a whole in the future we don t have to learn from other countries which is much more difficult we have to learn from our own better performing statesfinally we are doing very well in some of the new sectors as software and it services the total impact may be small at present but it has high potential the present slowdown notwithstanding more importantly it shows how well we can compete when conditions are right and also the potential for new entrepreneurship20of course the fiscal deficit remains a major problem it is a first generation reform which has fallen by the  wayside there was an improvement in the first two years of the reform but since then there has been a   steady deterioration the fiscal situation in the states in particular has got much worse unless we completethis first generation agenda the second generation reforms may get derailed20  why is this so20on the expenditure side there has been a steady expansion in current expenditure at the expense of   investment on the revenue side the tax ratio remains below the 1990 level we have also not done enough to raise user charges either in the centre or the states the crisis in the power sector is a good example the sebs as a group have losses of about rs25000 crores per year we have also not met disinvestment targetswould you say the political will to tackle this is lacking well i am an optimist so i would like to put it differently these are clearly difficult issues which can only be tackled over time the major good news is that there is much greater realisation in political circles today that the present path is nonsustainable six or seven years ago this realisation wasn t there certainly not at the state level there was a tendency to think   that problems can be solved by the centre giving more resources today state chief ministers know that their fiscal problem cannot be solved by the centre many states are even talking the language of fiscal reform and even more important power sector reform of course talking is not enough if some states begin to move ahead we will all begin to see light at the end of the tunnelso it is state chief ministers who must now lead reform you are not hopeful that the centre will provide that leadershipthe centre must certainly take parallel action in its area but i would not call this leadership each has a well defined agenda the central side agenda has been clearly laid out in the report of the prime ministers economic advisory council these ideas have been there for ten years you wrote a paper which came to be referred to as the mpaper when mr v p singh was prime minister ten years later we are saying the same things that paper did point in the direction where we have been going in this decade it is not correct to say that there has been no action what has been achieved in the last ten years goes much beyond what was proposed in that paper which was after all only a 2year agenda at the time policy today has certainly gone much further which is goodbut that is largely on the external policy front and in industrial policy public finances are where they were 20that is indeed the area which is weakest but let us recognise some gains even on the fiscal front we have made great progress in rationalising the tax system by creating incentives for people to be more honest tax ratios to gdp for personal and corporate taxation have improved though they are still too low the main reason why the tax ratio has not improved is that the decline in customs revenue which was to be expected has not been matched by an offsetting increase in revenues from excise duties there is a great deal of leakage in this area the absence of services in the tax net is also a major problem we should really move to a modern integrated vat which is the least distortive form of indirect taxation if we could move to a vat covering goods and services we could generate additional revenues of two to three per cent of gdp this has been the experience of many countries which have adopted an integrated vat however that requires a constitutional amendment pending that we have to rationalise the excise duty structure and integrate services taxation with goods in an expanded cenvat the parthasarathy shome committee has made some new interesting  proposals in this regardi am emphasising the changes needed on the revenue side because there is really no margin available to   reduce the total government expenditure to gdp ratio on the expenditure side what we need is a   restructuring of expenditures in which we reduce subsidies and wasteful current expenditures but use the   resources released to increase public investment in education health care roads both highways and rural   roads and other economic infrastructure where the private sector will not invest in short total government expenditure in india is not too high the political support for cutting expenditure and downsizing the   bureaucracy can only come if this is seen as a redirection of expenditure to other more important uses the improvement in the fiscal balance must therefore come from the revenue side we are not mobilising as much as we should from existing rate structure and we are not doing enough to raise user charges for services provided by the government whether it is the railways or higher education or power or provision of municipal services we must increase user charges so that these systems generate the revenues needed to ensure efficient supplyif this does not happen can the economy attain the eight per cent growth that the draft tenth five year plan would like to see in the next five yearsif we don t tackle the fiscal problem facing the government we will not be able to undertake essential public investment in social and economic infrastructure interest rates will remain high which means private investment will also not take place and the growth we have targeted will definitely not be possible the planning commission has said this loud and clear in the approach document 10th plan the pm s economic advisory council has said the same thingi must emphasise that the recipe for high growth is not just public investment private investment is 70 of   total investment and high growth depends crucially on private investment and its efficiency reforms must   continue if private enterprise is to do its bit but this growth process needs to be underpinned by public   investment in crucial sectors of social and economic infrastructure which depends on the fiscal health of the   governmentdo you see economic growth getting stuck at the 55 to 60 of the past two decades and economic   policy getting stuck in political debates20i certainly hope not but that depends on whether our policies evolve in the right direction i remain hopeful  mainly because we have been able to move forward in the past decade even if fitfully five years ago we were debating insurance sector liberalisation now that is done with and over and nobody worries about it even on privatisation look at balco there were fundamentalist positions being taken but the issue has been resolved from the fact that something looks very difficult today we should not conclude that nothing will happen however we must recognise that we cannot continue with this slow pace of change it is not enough to make progress compared to the past in a competitive world we have to benchmark against our competitors and that is where progress is clearly not fast enough i hope the tenth plan can be used as an opportunity to rereview the momentum on a core set of policy changes if that is done we should be able to reach 80 growth otherwise it will be difficultare you worried that this year again we might slip on growththe economy is decelerating at present and the first two months of this fiscal year show no immediate sign of a turnaround it is difficult to say whether the situation will turn around in the rest of this year the global slowdown will certainly hold back investment however shortterm prospects are not the only issue the issue for us is to outline what we need to do to move on to a higher growth path of 80 or so over the next 5 yearsin your two decades in economic policy making what have been the most difficult challenges you have had to facethe most difficult challenge was clearly getting out of the crisis of 1991 it is difficult to imagine now how difficult the situation was then the rbi was forced to restrict access to foreign exchange for exporters in order to manage its low reserves position by 1993 the entire crisis was behind us the critics of liberalisation and there were many predicted at the time that the policy of liberalising external controls would be an absolute disaster i take some satisfaction that these critics were proved comprehensively wrong the policy initiatives were well grounded in both economic theory and practice  especially the experience of other countries and they workedthis suggests that if we are serious about change it is not necessary to wait to generate political consensus which would ensure support from all quarters we have to look two years ahead and hope that people will come around to supporting the reforms if they work the experience of the last ten years certainly tells us that while change is resisted when it is proposed and this is possibly even a good thing since it generates debate and shapes policy in a way that makes it acceptable to a wider constituencyat the end of the day people accept sensible policies the press plays a major role in persuading people i must say that so far ithas generally backed sensible policiesthe policies of the last decade have been criticised for getting the sequencing wrong indian industry has said that it was wrong to have done so much on external liberalisation without doing enough on internal liberalisation is this fair criticism20i don t think this is entirely fair it is not true to say that domestic liberalisation was not bold we got rid of ind

averts senate contempt finding by emily bazarbee capitol bureaupublished sept 14 2001 state lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against enron corp on thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately the lastminute wrangling between enron and a special senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929 following hours of closeddoor meetings enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full senate and the possibility of stiff fines under the deal enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over it took too long to bring this to resolution said state sen joe dunn dsanta ana who chairs the committee i can t help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt as part of the deal however enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in july asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman karen denne she said the company is still considering its options we re pleased they ve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges denne said enron  and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them  had been found in contempt in late june after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on june 11 the subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details  prices quantities and capacity  of the companies  transactions in the state s wholesale electricity market enron officials balked at the request saying they didn t want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the senate thursday morning the senate rules committee met to consider the committee s contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines after an hour of fingerpointing and confusing allegations senate president pro tem john burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences at 6 pm enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies in addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the sacramento municipal utility district smud was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents the bee s emily bazar can be reached at 916 3265540 or ebazarsacbeecom mailtoebazarsacbeecomenron and state reach agreement on papers the power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market september 14 2001 by kimberly kindythe orange county register sacramento  enron corp signed a confidentiality agreement late thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a senate investigation into the california electricity market the compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations at stake for enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines the senate rules committee on thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full senate to hold enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents while delaying the decision senate leader john burton dsan francisco ordered attorneys from the legislative counsel of california a senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets let s hope cooler minds prevail said rules committee member sen ross johnson rirvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting the contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said sen joe dunn dsanta ana who chairs the senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late thursday the state senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation s two largest publicemployee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the legislature the legislative counsel of california is recommending the action it is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the california legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of california said dunn who asked for the counsel s review and recommendation enron agrees to turn over documents to senate investigators by jennifer colemanassociated press september 13 2001 sacramento  enron corp agreed thursday to release company documents to a senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committee s quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena the senate rules committee heard arguments from enron and the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt in june the select committee subpoenaed enron files as part of its investigation into recordhigh prices in the state s wholesale electricity market enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected the judge agreed however that enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information sen joe dunn dsanta ana chairman of the select committee said late thursday that enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators with that agreement dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended enron be found in contempt he said he expects documents to be transferred immediately dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt he asked sen john burton dsan francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against enron for each day they didn t comply with the subpoena the daily fines would start at 1000 doubling each day for 10 days then the company would be fined 1 million a day enron lawyer michael kirby said the company had put 49000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in sacramento so committee investigators could review them but dennis murphy a lawyer for the select committee said enron didn t tell investigators where the depository was located the committee discovered the address in documents filed by enron for the court case he said we ve been trying to get into the depository for a week they have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents the two parties haven t met since the judge ordered the protective order and kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order s details dunn said the law requires enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order sen ross johnson rirvine said dunn s push to have enron found in contempt smacks at this point of enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate a contempt finding against mirant corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee s investigators if the full senate imposes sanctions against reliant or enron it will be the first time since 1929 when the senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state

mcnulty and khozem merchanttata the indian conglomerate has held exploratory talks to buy a controversial power plant from enron the us energy giant tata power part of the bombaybased industrial group has written to the indian government expressing interest in the plant which is india s biggest foreign investment however it said any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project kenneth lay enron s chief executive and chairman told the financial times in august that enron and its partners wanted to retrieve the dollars 1bn incurred building the nowdefunct dabhol plant it is understood that enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar enron declined on friday to confirm it was in talks with tata but said the best solution would be for the indian government or one of its indian financial backers to take on dabhol tata power recently held talks with indian financial institutions involved with the project officials from dabhol power company enron s indian arm also attended about 70 per cent of the dabhol plant was funded by debt with indian financial institutions providing dollars 14bn and foreign lenders the balance enron s indian unit defaulted in september on interest payments to international lenders blaming stopped payments by the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the plant s sole client analysts favour a quick sale tata would be a faster exit and resolve it once and for all said ronald barone of ubs warburg it is better to take a small loss and move along dabhol periodically becomes a problem and an issue and it depresses the stock analysts said the fit between tata and its putative target would be complementary though it would probably stretch the company s balance sheet the tata group is already committed to a heavy capital expenditure of some rs30bn dollars 625m on powerrelated projects over the next three years a further rs9bn is slated for telecommunications and

2001 dow jones  company incsydney dow jones the spate of decisions by bigname participants to scale down or quit base metals trading last week didn t surprise participants in asia given the market s tough trading conditions they said in fact should the current dismal conditions prevail for the next six months more such announcements are likely they addedtheir comments follow the recent decisions by prominent members of the london metal exchange to either downsize their base metals trading divisions or quit entirely clearly they like us are victims of reduced volumes said a senior lme trader in sydney adding that all market participants are suffering from the declining throughputs and trade volumes figures from the lme s web site show that the trading volumes for aluminum copper lead nickel tin and zinc fell a total 106 to 41027075 contracts for the first nine months of this year from the same period last year we re just seeing the beginning of it a senior trader with a big usbased trading house in tokyo told dow jones newswires monday last week n m rothschild  sons ltd said it would cease base metals trading except for its australian business chairman evelyn de rothschild said in a statement in light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets we have concluded that our limited base metals operations are no longer viable scotiamocatta the base

ltd in july ceased its marketmaking activities to focus on clearing and broking the senior trader said he wasn t surprised by these developments and ominously projected more to come should the difficult trading conditions continue in the next six months market not pricing future demand people are really not pricing any future demand into their positions he said one indication is the lack of forward pricing in lme s base metals contracts despite the current depressed prices he said with lme threemonth copper and aluminum prices around 25 down from their levels at the start of the year he would have expected to see forward buying following previous experience but if everybody s restructuring you don t even know if you are going to be here into 2002 2003 he said despite having tumbled to very low levels analysts and market participants project further downside for base metals prices as they push back forecasts of a price recovery following the sept 11 terrorist attacks on the us one of japan s trading giants marubeni corp jmrb said monday that the attacks have pushed back the timing of the aluminum market s recovery by two to three months it also cut its forecasts for this year s trading range of the lme threemonth aluminum contract to 12501450 a metric ton compared with last year s 14511730ton range indeed the past few years have thrown base metals into extremely difficult trading conditions traders said just as the asian markets were recovering from the 1997 financial crisis the us economy sputtered to a halt they said the terrorist attacks sept 11 and the subsequent retaliation threw a spanner in the works they added the bellwether copper and aluminum contracts last week fell to their lowest levels in 28 months while zinc prices also notched 14year

company could be the major driver for the stock at this point it s by no means certain the deal will happen but if it does a lot would depend on how it is structured and the cost of the project he said it s definitely a big booster for sentiment as enron s unit supplies to areas contiguous to tata power s he said but there are concerns about how its cash flows will be impacted shares in tata

held preliminary talks with enron to buy the american firm s stake in the 29 billion dabhol unit everyone knows some solution has to be found for dabholwe will go ahead with this only if it makes sense from the consumers  angle and the stakeholders  angle he said dabhol was forced to shut its 740 mw plant on the west coast of india after its sole customer a stateowned lossridden indian utility

ltdasia africa intel wire business line the hindu copyright c 2001 kasturi  sons ltd all rights res dthe exit of enron and aes from the indian power scene has generated worry for more than affecting power generation this might have a lasting impact on the prospects of foreign direct investment in india this is because the us is the biggest investor in india and power generation was seen as one of the most attractive areas but then this did not happen suddenly and the portents were visible from ever since cogentrix pulled out but despite such fears fdi increased substantially in 2000 on an approval basis it increased 275 per cent in 2000 from 6750 million in 1999 to 8610 million in 2000 american investments rose 146 per cent from 8512 million in 1999 to 9756 million in 2000what then is the fallacy one reason why the flows were not affected is that overall the fdi trend in india is not affected by any sector no matter how important it is presently the policy constraints to foreign investment are confined to select sectors and sectoral policies are emerging the determinants of the fdi flow trend the policies in some sectors such as power telecommunications and oil may not be conducive but in others particularly manufacturing they are comparable to any other countrys even after a decade of liberalisation independent power producers are finding it difficult to set up operations with the state electricity boards in financial straits thus of the 50000 mw projects approved in the private sector only 3000 mw were added during 199199 nontransparent policies in basic cellular and wireless local loop services are preventing foreign investors from coming into the telecom and oil refining sector sin a big way nothing is as yet clear about the dismantling of administrative price mechanism in the petroleum sector that is scheduled for april 1 2002 however this is not true for other sectors in automotive or in electricalelectronic industries no mnc has so far pulled out instead more players are coming in as a result the actual flow of foreign investments has been in automobile and electricalelectric equipment sectors though fdi was approved largely in power and telecommunications for instance in 2000 nearly 30 per cent of the actual total flow of fdi was in the transport sector mainly automobiles and electrical equipment industries against only 15 per cent flow in power oil refinery and telecommunication in contrast 36 per cent of fdi was approved in transport and electrical industries against 41 per cent approved in power oil refinery and telecommunication during 2000 the automotive sector attracted a 12billion in fdi in the 1990s and grew at 20 per cent from 199199 the result of the flow of foreign investment and its impact on the industry further contradicting the fear hyped over the foreign investment prospect due to the enron exit a recent study by the american chamber of commerce reflected the us investors positive perception of indias vast potential according to the study the country has the potential to attract fdi of 100 million over the next five years if certain improvements are made in the regulatory measures and to the sectoral policies that are acting as barriers to foreign investors a study by the rbi unveiled a glorified result of the business performance of foreigninvested firms in india the study covering 334 firms revealed that their average return on equity was 12513 per cent during 199899 and 19992000 which in terms of global standards is lucrative the interesting part of the study is that the rate of return on equity in case of usinvested firms was as high as 12 per cent japanese and british firms however recorded higher returns on equity 22 per cent and 18 per cent respectively further these high rates of return on equity were reaped up mostly from domestic sales and the firms had to exert less to export and area where competition is intensifying by the day the study revealed that the ratio of export intensity of sales was 46 per cent during 199899 and 19992000 that is these firms are garnering higher returns by selling more than 95 per cent of their production in the domestic market in terms of industry the rbi study revealed that not only the return on equity but also the growth rate of returns were high in automobile and electrical industries thus the attraction of these sectors and the consequent large actual flows of fdi the return on equity in the auto industry was 146 per cent in 19992000 the second highest after pharmaceutical and the growth rate in return was 27 per cent over the previous years the return for the electrical equipment industry was 105 per cent in 19992000 and growth rate in return as high as 40 per cent over the previous year therefore the barriers often highlighted for the slow pace of fdi are not strictly related to the countrys overall policy the fdi gets bogged down because of sectoral policy constraints each different from the other the american chambers study admits that such macrolevel factors as inflexible labour laws and poor infrastructure play a relatively less important role in encouraging foreign investment than the sectoral policy constraints it is difficult to offer an ideal investment policy but certainly the country has inherent strengths such as skilled manpower huge domestic market and a stable democratic government that are conducive to attracting foreign investments the rbi study confirms this it only remains to tap this potential s majumdercopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all

is part of enron s move to pull out of all its projects in indiathe other two partners in the threemember consortium are mitsui osk lines mol which has 60 equity and indian national carrier shipping corporation of india sci with a 20 stake greenfield shipping had commissioned the construction of a 137000 cu m capacity lng tanker at mitsubishi shipyard in japan the vessel christened lng lakshmi will be ready for delivery on november 15 this year it will be used for ferrying lng from the middle east to enron s 2184 mw megapower plant at dabhol near ratnagiri in southern maharashtra although no official statement has come from enron a source at anz investment bank which leads the lending consortium of banks revealed that enron would seek the return of dollars 11m as its share of the paidup equity of dollars 55m plus dollars 19m for swapping the company s share of the loan component the highly publicised imbroglio between enron and maharashtra state electricity board over the tariff to be charged for power induced enron to seek an exit from the project this has induced the lending consortium to be extra cautious after having disbursed dollars 110m of the aggregate loan component of dollars 165m it has asked the promoters to bring in this amount the intransigence of the lenders has left mol and sci with the difficult task of not only paying enron off but also bringing in the dollars 55m debt amount if they are to take delivery of the vessel on the scheduled date next month the sci board has had extensive discussions on the subject but failed to come to a consensus on putting in the extra funds and during discussions held in london recently mol had clearly told the lenders it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the lng shipping deal mol feels the economics do not justify the extra expenditure the consortium is now facing a charter hire rate of dollars 60000dollars 65000 per day compared with the rate of dollars 98600 initially negotiated with the dabhol power company if one took a daily charter hire rate of dollars 60000 greenfield would earn around dollars 22m per annum of which dollars 4dollars 5m would be spent on operating expenses of the tanker that would leave dollars 17dollars 18m yielding an internal rate of return irr of just 78 for mol on its 60 equity stake this would be unacceptable for the japanese line for sci the irr would be even lower  445 far below the indian government norm of 12 for projects involving state fundingcopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved

 please see highlighted sections  anyone seen byron s plan  know where it s headed etcbestjeffpower purchase bills exceed 75 billion published tuesday july 10 2001 in the san jose mercury news by mark gladstone noam levey and dion nissenbaum mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento  six months after jumping into the electricity business the davis administration on monday provided the first detailed glimpse of california s daily power purchases showing more than 5 billion in payments much of it to governmentowned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers the state spent an additional 25 billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data in roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out 12 billion to atlantabased mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by 1 billion to powerex the marketing arm of bc hydro in british columbia it also paid 331 million to the los angeles department of water and power the documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis for instance almost 40 percent of the state s purchases have come from governmentrun power generators in california and elsewhere but not texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the northwest gov gray davis who has ambitions to run for the white house has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in president bush s home state the figures are tucked inside 1770 of pages of invoices that davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more the state which last month released information on its longterm electricity contracts worth 43 billion agreed thursday to release the first quarter details short on explanation the figures were disclosed late monday by the california department of water resources which buys power for the state s financially strapped major utilities and seem to buttress the administration s contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease in january for instance the average price for power on the spot market was 321 a megawatt hour it peaked in april at 332 and dropped to 271 in may one megawatt powers about 750 homes davis spokesman steve maviglio said the price data supports the governor s assertions that california has been gouged the bad guys are clearly the outofstate generators   maviglio said there has been a significant shift of money out of california   but the documents fail to shed much light on whether as the administration contends the price drop was due to longterm power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year critics contend that the davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years used for support republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against davis a democrat for signing longterm contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants it s more clear than ever that the longterm contracts are a bad deal   said assemblyman tony strickland rcamarillo the governor s really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years   the newly released bills highlight the volatility of california s energy market where the price per megawatt hour ranged from 70 to 1000 on any given day the records show the prices from seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside texas on one day in february for example san diegobased sempra energy was charging 165 per megawatt hour the eugene water and electric board was charging nearly 500 and duke energy a north carolina company was charging up to 575 the state s daily spending peaked may 10 at 1024 million for all power including the spot market and contracted power the state began buying power in midjanuary on behalf of the state s major utilities which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity san josebased calpine corp which is building several new power plants around california including one in south san jose did only 29 million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year according to the figures the state began buying power in midjanuary when pacific gas  electric co and southern california edison co were on the ropes financially pge later went into bankruptcy on monday state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing edison while most concede that a rescue plan davis worked out with edison will not win the necessary support in the legislature lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives compromise plan on monday state sen byron sher dredwood city unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the edison bailout the shared pain   proposal would force power producers owed about 1 billion to take a 30 percent haircut   and agree to forgive about 300 million in edison debts edison would be asked to swallow 12 billion  about a third of its debt and big users would be asked to pay off the remaining 2 billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for power in exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals sher presented the proposal to senate democrats monday afternoon but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the legislature contact mark gladstone at mgladstonesjmercurycom or 916 3254314

regarding pacific gas  electric s decision to file for bankruptcythe uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of california s oldest businesses while this is a significant and unwelcome development our team of bankruptcy litigators has beenpreparing for several months to defend california taxpayers in the event of a utility bankruptcy this morning i spoke with a pge executive and he personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay the state for its purchase of energy andto repay its renewable energy suppliercreditors qualified facilities i am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent necessary over the last several months our state attorneys have fought hard in the courts to ensure that outofstategenerators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies to californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state s two major utilities the health and safety of californians and the future of our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy business decisions of generators marketers and utilities justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of californians must pay back what they owe i will use all the considerable resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the bills affordable for every california home and business to recover california tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly taken and to punish wrongdoersaward to informantsit is possible that one or more members of the public can help with information and if so the financial reward to such a person or persons could be enormous my office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy providers have violated any laws over the last four years state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas under california false claims law any person or corporation who obtains state taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties that can be as high as three times the actual losses and anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may be entitled to a percentage share in that award since billions of state dollars may be recovered the award to an informant could potentially range from 50 million to thehundreds of millions of dollars i am asking any

httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchive20010325mn30195dtl gov gray davis faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers  electricity bills is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve the chronicle has learned sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a socalled structured rate system top officials from his own administration told lawmakers friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the 10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of california s nearbankrupt utilities if so the officials warned that consumers  electricity rates could double in the case of pacific gas and electric co this would mean customers  average monthly power bills would rise from 60 to 120 consumers throughout the bay area believe that at least some increase is on the way we re going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said larry webster a retired caltrans worker in redwood city we might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel it s a dime if you re going to use it let s pay for it steve maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double the figures reported in the press he said were wildly high the governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure  maviglio said until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities you can t conclude anything the state is negotiating a multibilliondollar bailout package with pge and southern california edison co to relieve the utilities of about 13 billion in debt pge and edison have been saying for months that there is no way california can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates the irony of the davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies the state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall said john nelson a pge spokesman either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up the disparity is too large statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of california s energy situation to ratepayers  and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor cost vs outagesif given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills i don t like either choice said janet leroux facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown san francisco candy store but i guess i d go with higher rates i sure didn t like the blackouts publicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within the existing rate structure  a stealthy way of saying that january s 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place but privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years sources said utility executives and power generators told the chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards for the good of california it s inevitable said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum a menlo park energy industry association sacramento resident john hax observed that when temperatures soar in the central valley this summer he d be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on it s like gasoline he said i don t like paying higher prices for gasoline but that s the price of doing business ratepayers draw the line though at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent if it was 20 percent i d probably do it said tracy resident mark dougherty but if it was more like 50 percent i d rather go with rolling blackouts i d rather have blackouts agreed jenny soghomonian owner of a shoe repair shop in san francisco s financial district i don t want to pay rates that are so much higher not every cost palatablethis is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking while consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts they aren t willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said tom higgins senior vice president of edison international parent company of southern california edison simply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to do so rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response requiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers but a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures it adjusts consumer behavior higgins said people want to get their bills back down rates  effect on usagehe and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor  a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer it s intellectually dishonest to think there s any other way out of this higgins said consumer activists  initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear no no no no bailout no rate increases no secret deals said harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica we need to get back to a regulated system rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor s ointment he has threatened to push through a ballot initiative reregulating california s power market if davis cannot find a consumerfriendly way out of the current fix because of rosenfield s past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates which delivered about 800 million to consumers his threat is taken seriously in sacramento we ve paid too much already rosenfield said a fair price is what we were promised by deregulation which was a 20 percent rate decrease however when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor s staff rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric big users should pay more he said after a moment s reflection i m open to a tiered system but only if it s fair rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with davis move toward structured ratesclearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers the california public utilities commission is scheduled to address january s 9 percent rate increase on tuesday that increase originally was given only a threemonth duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months if not longer puc president loretta lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system i am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said people who use a whole lot of power should pay more the biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that california is purchasing power on behalf of its cashpoor utilities the state already has spent about 4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers san francisco resident rosita magee accepts that for california to find its energy footing once more rates will probably be heading up that way you have more convenience and electricity more stability she said but magee has come up with another solution one that doesn t involve rate increases and rolling blackouts she s moving to texas chronicle staff writers matthew stannard and pia sarkar contributed to this report  email david lazarus at dlazarussfchroniclecom 2001 san francisco chronicle  pagea

added to the public resources code to reada notwithstanding any other provision of law the commission shallrequire as a condition of certification that the applicant shall offer toenter into a

change  oneof the amendments taken would clarify that only owners of the divestedplants would be subject to the provisions in the bill  several generatorsmet with speier this week to plead their case with little affect  themeasure will go to the senate floor next and is expected to pass  wherethis measure will find difficulties is in the assembly which will havealready passed out ab 8x migden which accomplishes the same goals as sb39x  chances are that the assembly eca committee would hold sb 39x indeference to the committee01s position on ab 8x  the same could be said forab 8x on the senate side but ab 8x came from the administration which maygive it more weight to move it forward the senate energy committee heard sb 47x battin which lowers thepayments of the purchase power

have some more background on the px credit issue that leads me to believe that we should still comment on pge s advice letterthe current px credit calculation relies on the existence of a px pricethe px price does not consistently reflect market pricesmarket prices are only reflected ifbuyers and seller are willing to take on credit risk by transacting in the marketthe legalities of who is liable for what in case of default are unclear according to a vp at epmi so the liquidity will not increase until there is certaintyfrom our perspective the market value as posted on the px is better for px credit calculations than a constrained iso price  there is no unconstrained iso price available  although  it s a riskhowever if the px becomes so dysfunctional that prices if any do not reflect real market pricing at all the cpuc cannot delay dealing with this issue because there will be no status quo for them to leave in place there will be a voidi suggest that we support the cpuc decision to delay hearing the advice letter with a big however  i think we should highlight the questionable viability of a px price and bring forward the requirement that the cpuc must act if the px becomes completely dysfunctional we could ask neil bresnan for help in defining dysfunctionaltamarajmb jbennettgmssrcom on 01252001 105438 amto tamara johnson email tjohnso8enroncom harry kingerski email

believe quite strongly within a four peer group structure  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of gov t public  affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov tpublic  affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities net income these individuals should be moved to specialized technicaland others who are performing a less strategic function who should remain in the commercial support category with that said it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  midyear prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved for yearend purposes where the compensation impact would be felt if we stay with the four group stucture i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov t affairs by yearend    on a completely seperate issue i continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the preferred distribution  relative to the bottom category for  commercial support groupsi m not implying this is nt an issue for commercial groups i just don t have the same ability to assess the impact therethe concern simply stated  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron particularly after going thru the past year where many of the nonperformers in my group and others  were moved out of the company the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a preferred distribution are quite highand that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour       thanks     enron energy services  from  david w delainey  ees                           05102001 1026 am   sent by kay chapmaneesto david w delaineyhouees philippe a

consolidated peer group mapping for all business units this mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at year end 2000 vp prcwe were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3 it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups all functionsactivities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached the actions points from this excercise are1 to review and agree the attached mapping 2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  as indicated on the attachment3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation      please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25      to have this

our analysis is determining what the governing law ofthe surety bond will be for each issuer and more importantly whether wecan have the bonds governed by texas law  can you answer this for mealso with respect to the form of the bond itself as we mentioned at themeeting the language in the third paragraph which states that if theprincipal shall promptly and faithfully provide the firm energy as definedin the confirm hen this obligation shall be null and void does not workfor us  has anyone come up with alternative language  finally withrespect to the notice of claim we would like for the certification to saysomething like an event of default has occurred under the masteragreement rather than tie it to a specific default under the confirmationdoes that work for the suretiesi look

chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,today we announced plans to merge with dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ve worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transactiondeal terms the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 02685 dynegy shares for every enron share  for example each 1000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy s outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest 15 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest 15 billion in cash in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas   total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares   the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next yearenron will have immediate access to dynegy s 15 billion cash investment in enron s northern natural gas subsidiarymanagement of newly formed companychuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company which will be called dynegy inc and steve bergstrom will be president and cooi will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enronmanagement from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration  the makeup of the integration team has not yet been determinedthe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002  this merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers  as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possibleas i said in my video this is a day like no other in our company s history  we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businessesi know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at httphomeenroncomupdates  if you have additional questions please submit them to

paul.d.thomas@enron.com,daarontaylor@hotmail.com,xfilename paul d thomas 62602pstaaronthe house we live in is about 1700 sq foot older home that needed some fixing up  at the time i thought we paid too much however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home  the houston texans a very original name have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake  also they have totally redone south main blvd creating a nice thoroughfare the area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood  however home values go up and down just like the stock market  most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable therewhen we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare i think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job  i prefer to do it myself i like the way it looks when i do it and it is whole lot cheaper  one day the contractor almost died in the house he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of advil to ease the pain however he did this on an empty stomach  he had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week  he ended up returning and finishing the job  anyways i have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time i will have a better idea on how to get things done  it was hard to organize and quality assure the job since i had just started a demanding job here at enron  all in all i think france or us you run into the same types of problems with contractors  talking about wild flowers and plants the same is true for costa rica   plants that only grow indoors with great care in houston grow like weeds in costa rica  i recommend that on your places to go listmerry christmas feliz natal and feliz

nice marriage  when we got married it was nothingextraordinary just a small and informal marriage celebrationyeah i know braeswood and buffalo  i m sure you paid a pretty penny forthe neighbourhood  it s a nice area  we ve done horrendous amounts ofwork to our apartment  we are doing something like a loft with it and wehad to gut it by removing most of the walls and floors etc  soon we willbe putting in a mezzanine floor it s a trendy thing here  we had two hugebins full of debris in front of our home for about a week  artisans infrance don t like working very much and when they decide to work they dojust enough of it to get by so customers are very unsatisfied when they arefinished  inevitably the customer must always bargain the price down atthe end because more artisans must be hired to come in and finish all thatwhich was not done  it s a hell of a mess but to be fair the same problemsexist in the states it s just that i ve never owned a home before  in theend i decided it s much easier and faster to do it yourself and bypass thecontractor all together  plus you can do a much better job yourselfyes i need to go to rio  i ve been to hawaii and to date it is the mostbeautiful place i have ever seen  waikiki has exotic flowers  that cost15 a piece anywhere else  growing on the sidewalks like any ordinaryflowerbtw i was thoroughly impressed with yosemite  i ve been trying to plan avacation back there ever since we leftkudosaaron original message from pauldthomasenroncomto daarontaylorhotmailcomsent tuesday december 18 2001 944 amsubject re hellowell aaronit

the bankwe are now considering paying it off however i am not sure for how muchlonger we will live there therefore not sure if we really want to pay itoffas far as children go we are still waiting for the right time  i imaginewe will have one in a year or so right now we are enjoying takingvacations on a whim  went to rio in early sept and got stuck there forweek and 12 due to the terrorist attacks  not such a bad place to bestuck  i definitely would encourage you to take a trip there  it isdifferent from most great cities in the world  for example paris romelondon nyc are all famous for the great buildings etc however rio isone of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see as far as acity settings go  the huge majestic tropical mountains merging with thewhite sand beaches and blue sea  it is the cidade maravillosatake care and have a great christmaspaul    original message   from   daarontaylor at hotmail dot com daarontaylorhotmailcom             enron   sent   monday december 17 2001 236 pm   to     thomas paul d   subject  re hello   hi paul   how have you been  how is enron treating you well i hope   yeah we moved to lyon at the beginning of 2000  when looking at a map   of   our solar system lyon is practically in the center of france  we re   more   or less located at the foot of the french alps  at about a million   people   lyon is smaller than houston   because of the internet boom my internet investments appreciated enough   to   buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the   city  we ve been renovating it ever since  i ve learned a hell of a   lot   about working on homes   before david underwood got fired he told me that you got married and   bought   a house in or near linkwood off stella link  i imagine you married   that   young brazilian lady that you were dating while at genesis   flicitations   have you been to brazil  i d like to see it one day if ever the   opportunity   presents itself  since you re hitched now i guess you are obligated to   have children soon    so yes since the 22nd of september i ve been the proud father of a baby   girl  camille  she s a real angel and quite a character too read   rascal  i hope enron allows you to receive email attachments that are   not   work related because i ve attached a photo of her that is as recent as   tonight  she s got brown eyes like her mommy   i heard you went to nyc  how did you like it  i love nyc and i was   just   there one week ago  no matter how many times i go there i will never   run   out of things to do  this last time i saw an exhibit on brazil at the   guggenheim  there are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that   i ve not seen so i know i will return  actually i ponder the idea of   getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little   american culture for six months at a time nyc is only six hours from   paris  since camille is american i think this would be good for her   of   course the problem is the price of an apartment  it s bloody expensive   mate  stress bloody  i asked one agency and they told me 450000 for   a   studio apartment in a nice area on manhattan i don t know how accurate   this   offthecuff quote was  that s a little too much for me unless i get a   mortgage which i horror the idea of owing any bank money  perhaps   something   cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood  you know the ones with   ugly   whores hanging around every small street intersection  then there s   harlem   maybe i can get a pad next to clinton s   june 10th 2000 we got married for a second time  the marriage was in   france and all my inlaws attended as well as my mother and aunt too   they   my mother and aunt were a little shocked to say the least  they speak   no   french and were like fish out of water to say the least  but you   didn t   hear this from me   i ve tons of little daytoday stories that are worth a laugh but this   email covers all the big stuff

to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares diluting the position of current shareholders however enron treasurer ben glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about 33 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities  known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the notes are coming due during the next 20 monthsmr glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes also enron is selling other assets proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by enron he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 22 billion by the end of next year this amount includes cash proceeds of 155 billion from the previously announced sale of enron s portland general electric utility unit enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002 there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes mr glisan said but if we are wrong we will issue equity mr glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 billion in stock enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron s share price in 4 pm new york stock exchange composite trading enron shares were down 86 cents to 1979 the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands early this year enron stock was more than 80 a share during the past week shares of the energytrading giant have dropped more than 40 early last week enron reported a 618 million thirdquarter loss resulting from 101 billion in writeoffs the company also disclosed a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow in july mr fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors on monday enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr fastow enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while we are extremely disappointed with our stock price    our businesses are performing very well mr lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs mr fastow the chief financial officer took part in the conference call but neither he nor mr lay would answer any questions concerning the fastowrelated partnership which was known as ljm2 coinvestment lp mr lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement which has raised conflictofinterest questions among analysts and others mr lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions mr lay said he was very concerned about the way andy s character has been loosely tossed about he added we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy internal ljm2 documents indicate that mr fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljm2related transactions according to enron sec filings during the conference call analysts  even some who have been longtime enron fans  challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the company s often opaque financial reports there s the appearance you are hiding something said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board mr lay

norris10242001the new york timespage 1 column 5c 2001 new york times companyenron has ample access to cash the company s chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enron s stock plunged on monday the chief executive kenneth w lay strongly defended the company s chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking intobut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s fastow the chief financial officer in addition mr fastow while declaring that enron   expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations   declined to answer any questions about it the conference call which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to 2325 but it soon began falling and ended the day down 86 cents at 1979 the day s low of 1962 was the lowest since jan 12 1998 and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000 until recently most investors focused on the company s reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing one involving partnerships controlled by mr fastow led to a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to sec inquiries that the company disclosed on monday one of the company s strongest supporters has been david fleischer an analyst at goldman sachs but he told mr lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information   there is an appearance that you are hiding something   he said after the call mr fleischer expressed disappointment   they ve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand   he said in an interview   they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them   as is needed he said but he said he was still recommending the stock   i don t think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans   he said   in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here   mr lay cited the sec inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr fastow but he emphasized that both he and the company s board   continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy   mr lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enron s reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called marlin that company owns onethird of azurix an enron subsidiary that owns wessex a british water utility the auditors   have determined there is no writedown required   he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management a money management firm mr grubman said that marlin owed almost 1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake noting that enron had paid about 300 million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in azurix mr grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares mr lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details eventually he cut off mr grubman   i know you re trying to drive the stock price down and you ve done a pretty good job of it   mr lay said   but let s move on to the next question   mr fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had 185 billion in such debt outstanding he said it was backed by 335 billion in bank lines of credit of which 175 billion will expire next may if it is not renewed mr lay said he was sorry about   the misunderstanding   that resulted when his brief mention of the 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement the sec is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin mr lay said the company   will look into providing   such statementscopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved  options reportsurge in optimism prompts

criticism over chief financial officer andrew fastow s former role with two partnerships ljm cayman and ljm2 coinvestment that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with enron enron disclosed monday that the securities and exchange commission opened an informal inquiry into transactions between enron and the two partnerships it declined to say if the sec is looking into other transactions after the disclosure enron s stock fell almost 21 percent monday tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at 1979 the news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on wall street that some of enron s financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that enron doesn t provide detailed enough financial data about its performance tuesday morning enron chairman and ceo ken lay held a conference call for investors and analysts aimed at addressing their concerns it remains to be seen whether he succeeded but based on the tenor of questions during the call it s doubtful he achieved that result david fleischer a goldman sachs analyst told lay that the company s credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that enron s dealings are aboveboard i for one find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions he said lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the ljm partnerships because of the sec inquiry he did say enron was aware an inherent conflict of interest would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with enron in response enron set up procedures which lay said were rigorously followed to ensure shareholder interests wouldn t be compromised there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron he said adding that enron wasn t obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enron s best interest lay and enron s board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in fastow he added fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships it took a 35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders  equity by 12 billion as a result during the call enron executives also addressed other issues they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles whitewing and the atlantic water trust that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or enron shares at the time of the investments if enron should lose its current investmentgrade quality debt rating commitments made as part

of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986 the tax which the house legislation also would repeal outright is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and creditsibm would get a 14 billion refund according to the nonpartisan congressional research service while gm would get 832 million kmart 102 million and

motor co would get a refund that could total 23 billion while chevron s could reach 314 million counting repeal of the tax corporations would get more than 25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone in addition the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business providing them 21 billion in tax relief over 10 years the generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the house gop measure scheduled for a floor vote wednesday democrats say the measure is certain to change once it

jean.mrha@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,louisei think what i really wanted to convey is the following1 john grass originally headed up the wellhead desk and outsourcing efforts for the producer segment  i wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services2 when the volume of the wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of contract focus with ocean energy andex and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued i asked kevin miller to manage producer outsourcing and john grass to manage only the wellhead desk3 based on kevin miller s memo attached below the wellhead desk reporting into hunter i have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the wellhead deskregards mrha original messagefrom  miller kevin  sent friday october 12 2001 446 pmto mrha jeansubject producer one updatejean per your request attached herewith is the rather lengthy producer one update thanks  kevin

bryant@cheatsheets.net,cheatsheets@egroups.com,hi  folksit s crunch time so  let s jump right into our  upgraded and downgraded20players as we head down the home  stretch identifying those players moving20up or down can be the difference  betweendominating the playoffs or watching20from the sidelines as we head into our 15th week  of listing these players20it01s inevitable that some guys will have made both the  upgrade or downgrade20list make  sure you understand what we01re talking about is players that20are moving in other words a player like te ricky  dudley could appear on20the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league20it just  means i01m concerned about the way he seems to be heading likewise20a player like wr willie  jackson may make the upgrade list even though he01s20still fairly far down the  list of wrs it01s all about which  direction20players are moving  keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often20make all the  differencejoeupgrades and  downgrades some of these  players are obvious moves up or20down and some aren t as clear here s my  list of guys i see moving this20weekqbs moving  upqb aaron brooks  no we keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering 20another outstanding game sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 tds as he 20went 30 for 48 the saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appears20brooks will continue to air the ball out yes he ll make some  young qb20mistakes and i d be surprised if he didn t throw as many interceptions  as he20does tds i expect him to throw a lot of both i almost  started him over20peyton manning in my local league but didn t pull the  trigger manning was20solid but brooks was betterqb kordell stewart  pit kordell made our upgrade list last week and here20he sits  again it took a few years but he s showing folks that maybe 199720was no  fluke he showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked20out with  a bad knee or calf depending on whether you listen to coach bill20cowher or  stewart the td rush was highlight material his problem all20along  seems to have been confidence and he s surely brimming with it now20kent  graham was so bad i won t even mention him in the downgrades but he put20on a  horrid display when he was in the game he s  awfulqb jay fiedler  mia dan fouts said on monday night football a few weeks20ago  that a nice pass just thrown by fiedler was as pretty as anything dan20marino  ever threw fiedler has those moments and he was having them fairly20often  against the supposedly tough bills where they were supposedly going to20have an  advantage in their cold weather didn t play out that way20fiedler  looks pretty darn goodqb jeff garcia  sf we had him high in week 14 like we have all year and20he  didn t disappoint wr terrell owens was a huge help and apparently20jerry  rice s wifeharping on the radio had some sort of positive effect 20the chargers had been very tough against the pass and garcia shredded  themqb brett favre  gb i have a hard time putting a finger on it but this guy20just  does what it takes to get the job done he d be much better off if wr 20antonio freeman earned 10 of his paycheck but in the meantime bill20schroeder s  doing a great job20qb jeff george  was lil danny snyder removed the primary obstacle to20keeping  his qb jeff george off the field by firing norv turner monday20george  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year20although  tying snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch i m a20jeff  george fan though and he does give the team a big arm we ll see how20it  goes but at least it looks as if he ll get his shotrbs moving  uprb mike anderson  den like you need me to tell you this the fact that20he  ran buck wild on a tough new orleans defense made the effort all the20more  impressive he bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to20be  good for sunday clearly the denver ol is the star on this team so if20you  own anderson it s probably not a bad idea to grab karon coleman for the20stretch  run20rb fred taylor  jac for all the earlyripping i ve done to taylor he s 20performed just as we predicted he would lately  like a madman you don t 20need me to tell you he s been awesomerb warrick dunn  tb can the little guy take up the slack for mike20alstott  i ve got a couple hundred reasons that says yes ok rushing20for 200  against dallas is nothing special it s happened in 23 of the20cowboys games  this year but you have to admit dunn looked great  sundayrb corey dillon  cin one can only salivate about what he might do if he20played  for a team like denver the fact he can continue to roll up huge20yardage  on this team is amazing new qb scott mitchell is a huge boost as20he looks  like peyton manning back there compared to akili  smithrb ahman green  gb green s a guy that s finally living up to his 20potential you always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to 20be catching up mentally as well he showed a nice nose for the endzone 20sunday with the 2 tdsrb lamar smith  mia so much for the cold weather hamstring worries20smith  carried the load sunday in frigid buffalo and looked great it looks20to me  like he s picking up right where he left offrb terrell fletcher  sd it s not exactly the same as earning the starting20rb job in  tennessee or indianapolis but fletcher does seem to have nailed20down the 1 rb  slot in san diego and that s worth something you have to20decide  how muchrb fred beasley  sf we loved beasley early in the season as he racked up 20tds he got back in the mix sunday with 5 carries and a td the fb  for san20francisco has always been a valuable ff slot and beasley might be worth  the20roll of the dice if you re thin at rbrb shawn bryson  buf finally bryson does something besides make me look20bad for  hyping him he rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts sunday and20looks to  take advantage of sammy morris  ankle troubles20rb terry allen  no allen made an appearance sunday and with jerald moore20and  chad morton failing to astound anyone allen could get more looks20whether  he s got anything left in the tank remains to be seenwrs moving  upwr david boston  ari boston turned in a huge game sunday and has to be 20considered an upgrade he s a streaky guy but with frank sanders a total 20non factor boston is getting most of qb jake plummer s attention these 20days and with arizona almost certain to be playing from behind he could 20do some damagewr darrell jackson  sea jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had20cooled of  late he warmed up again sunday with jon kitna under center20it s  tough to depend on the seahawk passing game but jackson could be worth20a  shotwr curtis conway  sd conway has benefited the most from the ryan leaf 20resurgence he caught 7 passes sunday and should benefit as leaf continues 20to improvewr willie jackson  no jackson s officially moved past the flash in the20pan stage  with another solid day aaron brooks continues to look good at20qb  jackson may suffer a bit when jake reed gets healthy but for right now20he s  looking goodwr joe horn  no again qb aaron brooks delivers and horn is the prime 20recipient joe horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should 20continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn t get  untrackedwr bobby shaw  pit shaw may still be available in your league as the20starting  wr opposite hines ward he found the endzone again and continues20to make  some noise with kordell stewart quarterbackingwr terrell owens  sf the best news for jeff garcia owners had to be a20solid day  from terrell owens he s a huge boost to the offense when he can20go and it  looked like he d made progress with the toe keep an eye out for20how he  responds after the game but i liked what i sawwr shockmain davis  ne ok i ll be honest i m pretty much just including20him  here because he s the owner of the coolest name in the  leaguetes moving  upte dwayne carswell  den carswell s finally starting to emerge as the te of20choice  in denver his 62 yards sunday were second only to san diego s20freddie  jones you have to worry about desmond clark stealing time but i d20have no  trouble starting carswell each weekte reggie kelly  atl one of the few bright spots for atlanta has been the20play  of kelly he caught 4 passes for 44 yards sunday with a td new qb 20doug johnson may lean on him as he settles inte mark bruener  pit bruener makes the list not only for having another20solid  game but for making one of the best td runs after the catch sunday as20he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at the205 yard  linete andrew glover  no obviously the play of aaron brooks raises the level20of play  for all the saints receivers glover made a couple of nice plays20sunday  including a good looking td catchplayers moving  downqbs moving  downqb shane matthews  chi take a seat shane cade mcnown likely makes his 20return folks can hardly waitqb troy aikman  dal emmitt smith owners had to love it but did it seem20strange  to anyone else that the cowboys felt the best way to come back from20a huge  deficit against tampa was to feed the ball to emmitt clearly the20team  has zero faith in aikman s ability to throw the ballqb shaun king  tb i know he s had trouble with the back but 65 passing 20yards that s a joke he ll be better but i ve seen  enoughqb brad johnson  was it s the jeff george show at least untilgeorge 20looks bad for a few seriesqb rob johnson  buf in leagues that penalize for interceptions you d have20been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would ve rob20johnson  once again he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboardrbsmoving  downrb jamal anderson  atl anderson s not playing too badly but the team is20in  shambles after qb chris chandler was benched anderson vented some 20frustrations saying for all he knew he might be punting this week i 20don t think we ll see that but i also don t think we ll see the days of him 20seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the yearrb shaun alexander  sea rb ricky watters has proven to be less than an20ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball actually he s played so well20that  mike holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow of20his  star when the team is struggling as badly as it is you don t mess20with  the one thing that s workingphiladelphia  rbs forget about them this team will live and die by 20donovan mcnabbrb jermaine fazande  sd evidently fazande is the 2nd choice behind20terrell fletcher  now that s gotta hurtwrs moving  downwr joe jurevicius  nyg this has nothing to do with the play of jurevicius20as he s  been very solid but you have to think ike hilliard will be a factor20when he  returns he s no lock to go this week but he may be  closewr terrance mathis  atl mathis continues to struggle on a team that s in20a  tailspin new qb doug johnson seemed to like throwing to shawn jefferson 20which could spell more bad things for mathiswrs torrance small   charles johnson phi forget about it donovan mcnabb20can  be a solid qb without wrswrs james mcknight  wayne  mcgarity dal these guys just aren t very20mcgood qb troy  aikman is a mere shadow of his former selfwr marcus robinson  chi robinson s back troubles were apparently

abrupt economic20slowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands all of greenspan01s training and experience have taught him how to cope with conventional20downturns and so far he01s dealing with this one in the conventional manner01by cutting shortterm interest rates in quick but measured steps that may20well prove to be the right course but there01s a risk that this downturn is20different and that far steeper cuts in interest rates are needed to keep the20new economy from tumbling into a long and painful recession20in short alan greenspan is feeling the heat of a market
