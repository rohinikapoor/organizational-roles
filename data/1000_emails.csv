executive.office@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,"we know how interested all of you are in the retention & severance plan , so we want to update you on its status . as many of you know , we have been working with members of the creditors committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention & severance plan , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday , february 22 . we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month . we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention & severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave . we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed . we re learning that , in bankruptcy , most things don t move as quickly as we are accustomed . the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns . the creditors committee fully supports the implementation of a retention & severance plan . such plans align the company s objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy . these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate . the creditors committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process . to that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee . we intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible . this is currently our top priority , bar none ! when we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be . unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place . we now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation . the process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved . that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse . we remain committed to working with the creditors committee until we can reach agreement on a plan . we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of march 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court . we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court . with respect to non-debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future . in the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week . and of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible .",2002-02-28 15:20:49

"" we ve been given permission to credit these nox reductions against land-based projects , "" knut barland , vice-president for environment at statoil told reuters . "" and the kind of reduction we d be getting on these ships would meet the nox emission reduction target for one of these ( planned ) power plants . "" the north sea supply ships are small compared to cargo ships , but are so powerful they can be used to drag around oil rigs . they are usually so thirsty for diesel that they pump out as much nox pollution each day as several thousand cars . but by designing each of them to run on liquified natural gas ( lng ) , gas that has been super-cooled until it condenses as liquid , nox emissions from the two ships can be cut by 85 percent or 420 tonnes a year . "" that means one ship is equivalent to half the ( nox ) emissions from a gas-fired power station , "" said aksel skjervheim of naturgass vest , which will provide the ships with their super-cooled fuel . unique government approval statoil s barland said that the government had given it a unique permission to credit the nox reduction against land-based emissions , which could be from any one of five projects including two controversial 400 megawatt gas-fired power stations statoil is involved in . he said the power plants , one at kaarstoe and one at kollsnes near bergen , were planned by a joint venture between statoil , norsk hydro and statkraft . they are not controversial because of their nox emissions , but because of their carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions . "" we ve been granted permission for the co2 as long as we comply with kyoto , but keeping the nox down to the five parts per million ( ppm ) limit ( specified by the government ) could be very expensive , "" said barland . norway imposes a five ppm limit on nox emissions in some regions aimed at curbing acid rain . "" constructing a nox treatment plant would be a very expensive and very old-fashioned way , and therefore we ve been given the opportunity of finding a third party solution , "" he said . the shipping nox offset deal works out comparatively cheaply . the two hi-specification ships will cost statoil an extra nine million norwegian crowns per year to run , compared to conventional diesel-powered ships . but when converted into nox credits , they would allow statoil to cut emmissions at a cost of 22 crowns per kilogram ( kg ) , compared to 30-40 crowns per kg by building nox treatment into a new power plant . while this approach to emissions might help overcome the nox hurdle for the kaarstoe and kollsnes plants , the project might yet stumble on co2 limits . "" we could buy co2 emissions permits , but there s still a lot of political uncertainty over the cost and that is something we re having to consider very carefully , "" said barland . he said much would depend on kyoto s final mechanism for co2 emmissions trading and the extent to which norway adopted the measures . barland said he hoped the cost of future lng-powered ships would fall as more lng filling-stations were built around norway s coast , and shipyards gained the right expertise . to date only one lng-powered ship has been built , a norwegian fjord ferry , which runs on fuel from norway s only lng filling station , the aga-owned 15,000 tonne per year ( tpy ) mini-lng plant at tjeldbergodden . naturgass vest , in which statoil is a partner , hopes to build norway s second mini-lng plant of 30-40,000 tpy at kollsnes and later on another near stavanger . "" that will make lng-powered coastal shipping possible in norway , "" said barland . "" next time we issue a contract , we hope lng will be competitive in its own right .

"" 4 . in its november 1 , 2000 order , the federal energy regulatorycommission ( "" ferc "" ) expressly found that electricity prices in californiahave been maintained at "" unjust and unreasonable "" levels during the relevantperiod , though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto . in its november22 , 2000 response to the november 1st ferc order , the california publicutilities commission ( cpuc ) concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders , customers of electricity suppliedthrough the california power exchange had been overcharged more than $ 4billion dollars during the summer of 2000 . in its november 22nd response tothe november 1st ferc order , even the california independent system operator ( caiso ) which manages california s transmission system infrastructure , knownas the "" power grid "" , found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from theexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders . ii . venue5 . venue is proper because defendants each transact business in thestate of california and because the damages caused by defendants unlawfulmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in san diegocounty . iii . parties6 . plaintiff pamela r. gordon is an adult resident living in san diego , california . plaintiff pamela r. gordon is a retail electricity customer ofsdg & e , and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the classperiod ( defined infra ) that are unjust and unfair and that have beenartificially inflated by defendants misconduct . moreover , plaintiff pamelar . gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lackof circulation . exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff pamelar . gordon s legs to swell , which can lead to possible severe healthconsequences . as a result of her condition , plaintiff pamela r. gordon mustmaintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and71 degrees during the day . plaintiff pamela r. gordon is unable toterminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust andunfair rates for electricity from sdg & e as a result of defendants misconduct . specifically , plaintiff pamela r. gordon was charged and/orpaid the following rates for electricity by sdg & e during the class period : / / / / / / / / / / / / datestotal electric charges5-26 to 6-27-00 $ 180.926-27 to 7-27-00 $ 226.677-28 to 8-28-00 $ 311.848-28 to 9-27-00 $ 143.489-27 to 10-26-00 $ 84.717 . plaintiff was charged less for electricity per kwh prior to theclass period and the inception of defendants wrongful conduct : datestotal electric charges3-29 to 4-27-00 $ 100.508 . defendant reliant energy ( hereinafter "" reliant "" ) is a houston , texasbased public corporation doing business in the state of california asreliant energy services . it is a generator and trader of wholesaleelectricity which is ultimately sold to california consumers , includingplaintiff and the class , and is a wscc member . reliant operates fiveelectricity generating plants in california which supply wholesaleelectricity to the california power exchange .9 . defendant southern company ( hereinafter "" southern "" ) is an atlanta , georgia based public corporation doing business in the state of californiaas southern energy , inc . it is a generator and trader of wholesaleelectricity which is ultimately sold to california consumers , includingplaintiff and the class , and is a wscc member . southern energy operates sixelectricity generating plants in california which supply wholesaleelectricity to the california power exchange .10 . defendant dynegy , inc. ( hereinafter "" dynegy "" ) is a houston , texasbased public corporation doing business in the state of california as dynegymarketing and trade . it is a generator and trader of wholesale electricitywhich is ultimately sold to california consumers , including plaintiff andthe class , and is a wscc member . dynegy operates two electricity generatingpower plants in california which supply wholesale electricity to thecalifornia power exchange . 11 . defendant nrg energy , inc. ( hereinafter "" nrg "" ) is a minneapolis , minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of californiaas nrg , a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimatelysold to california consumers , including plaintiff and the class . inpartnership with defendant dynegy , nrg operates eight electricity generatingplants in california which supply wholesale electricity to the californiapower exchange .12 . defendant aes corporation ( hereinafter "" aes "" ) is an arlington , virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of californiaas aes pacific group , a generator and trader of wholesale electricity whichis ultimately sold to california consumers , including plaintiffs and theclass , and a wscc member . aes pacific group operates four electricitygenerating plants in southern california which supply wholesale electricityto the california power exchange .13 . defendant williams energy is a tulsa , oklahoma based

wholesale electricity to the california powerexchange .14 . defendant duke energy north america ( hereinafter "" duke energy "" ) is ahouston , texas based public corporation doing business in the state ofcalifornia as duke energy trading and marketing , llc , a generator and traderof wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to california consumers , including plaintiffs and the class , and a wscc member . duke energy operatesfour electricity generating plants in california which supply wholesaleelectricity to the california power exchange . 15 . defendants does 1 through 100 , inclusive , are sued herein underfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the plaintiff . when their true names and capacities are ascertained , plaintiff will amendthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein . plaintiff is informed and believe , and based thereon alleges , that each ofthe fictitiously named defendants is responsible in some manner for theoccurrences herein alleged , and thereby proximately caused injuries anddamages to plaintiff , as herein alleged . further , plaintiff is informed andbelieves , and upon such information and belief alleges , that each of thedefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefitedfrom the wrongful acts , conduct , and omissions described in this complaint , and that said acts , conduct , and omissions directly and proximately causedinjury and damages to plaintiff and the class as alleged below . iv . class action allegations16 . plaintiff brings this action pursuant to section 382 of the code ofcivil procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers , including the retail customers of san diego gas & electric company ( sdg & e ) , who purchased electricity supplied through the california power exchangeduring the period from may 22 , 2000 through and including the date of trial ( hereinafter the "" class period "" ) . all such persons and entities have paidand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "" unjust andunreasonable "" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power , improper use of confidential information , manipulations , and unlawful actions . members of the class are extremelynumerous and their joinder would be impracticable . approximately 1.2 million sdg & e customers are within the class .17 . common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues , including : - whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharingconfidential real time data in violation of iso tariffs and thereafter "" gamed "" the market ; - whether defendants charged "" unjust and unreasonable "" prices for electricityduring the class period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price forelectricity ; - whether defendants exercised "" market power "" in the california electricitymarket during the class period ; - whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should berefunded and paid to members of the class .18 . plaintiff s interests are typical of , and not antagonistic to , theinterests of the class .19 . plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class actionand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute thisaction .20 . a class action is superior to all other methods for the fair andefficient adjudication of this controversy . the size of the individualdamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of thedefendants operations and alleged misconduct . a class action is the onlymethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress andobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims . plaintiff does not anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action . / / / v. common allegations of facta . the california wholesale electricity markets21 . in 1996 california deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe state s privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants . the purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets , with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power . in fact , however , certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have , in violation of their operating tariff , takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity , yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of california consumers .22 . as part of the deregulation , several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market . california s investor ownedutilities , pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) , southern california edison ( sce ) , and san diego gas & electric ( sdg & e ) ( the "" utilities "" ) , now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders , including defendants , through a market known as the california powerexchange ( px ) . the px maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets . under the california deregulatory scheme , the utilities were , until just recently , required to purchase power through the px andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market .23 . the deregulated market also led to the creation of the californiaindependent system operator ( caiso ) . the caiso is an "" independent "" non-profit corporation , though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders , that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance , high-voltagepower lines that make up the bulk of california s transmission system . approximately 75 % of california s electricity is distributed through thecaiso managed "" power grid "" . the caiso monitors electrical loads ( i. e. , demand ) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand . / / / 24 . the caiso accomplishes this by maintaining a real time imbalancemarket ( the "" real time market "" ) . when the caiso receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power , it must acceptany bid , which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour . under thesingle price auction system used by the caiso , all sellers of electricity inthe real time market automatically receive the market clearing price , whichis the ( second ) highest price paid in the market , even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices . thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants , such as defendants , togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice .25 . the real time market was not designed to handle large transactions , but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand . defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand .26 . the caiso also manages the replacement reserve market , which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity . sellers in the replacementreserve market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity . ifcalled upon by the iso to deliver energy , sellers in the replacement reservemarket also receive the real time market price . thus , if generators knowthat capacity is short , they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the replacement reservemarket . access to real time generating information facilitates such "" gaming "" of the markets by demonstrating , in real time , available competingsupply .27 . in times of high demand , the caiso has the authority to purchaseenergy from out-of-state sources , as to which there is no operative pricecap . the caiso was forced to do so during the summer of 2000 . californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the californiamarkets . they can then resell that electricity to the caiso at inflated anduncapped prices . as the px compliance committee noted in its november 1,2000 report ( "" the px compliance report "" ) : / / / "" during periods of high out-of-market purchases , when prices are above thereal-time energy price cap , in-state generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of california . surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the caiso out-of-market calls and return it to thestate . "" id . at p. 44.28 . notably , the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370 % increasein exports from the california energy market , despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the state . "" market power "" is defined by the caiso as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time . generators and suppliers ( including defendants ) can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market , moving electricity outof the california markets , and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market .29 . notably , the california energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms , some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity . the small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof market power during periods of high demand , even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity . in addition , the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpower . b. defendants improper acts30 . prior to may 22 , 2000 , the caiso began supplying the western systemscoordinating council ( "" wscc "" ) , an organization consisting of electricindustry participants , including defendants , with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels , known as metering data , and transmissionsystem flow data , known as scheduling data , pertaining to individual marketparticipants . through the wscc internet web site , wholesale electricitymarket participants , including defendants herein , were thereby given accessto real time data as to their competitors actions , although access to suchdata was forbidden by the iso tariff . when requested by variousgovernmental entities , including the california public utilities commission ( "" cpuc "" ) the wscc refused access . / / / / / / / / / 31 . caiso/ferc tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part ; meter data supplied by an iso metered entity shall be made available by theiso to the scheduling coordinator representing such iso metered entity andother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement , but shallnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required bylaw , ferc any local regulatory authority or other provision of this isotariff .32 . caiso/ferc tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part : the iso shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents , data andinformation provided to it by any market participant that are treated asconfidential or commercially sensitive under section 20.3.2 ; provided , however , that the iso need not keep confidential : ( 1 ) information that isexplicitly subject to data exchange through wenet pursuant to section 6 ofthis iso tariff ; ( 2 ) information that the iso or the market participantproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this isotariff , or applicable regulatory requirements ( provided that the iso shallcomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure ) ; or ( 3 ) informationthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis ( other thanas a result of the iso s breach of this iso tariff ) .33 . caiso/ferc tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part : the following information provided to the iso by scheduling coordinatorsshall be treated by the iso as confidential : ( a ) individual bids for supplemental energy ; ( b ) individual adjustment bids for congestion management which are notdesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available ; ( c ) individual bids for ancillary services ; ( d ) transactions between scheduling coordinators ; ( e ) individual generator outage programs unless a generator makes achange to its generator outage program which causes congestion in the shortterm ( i. e. one month or less ) , in which case , the iso may publish the nameof that generator .34 . caiso/ferc tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part : no market participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the isoor to review any documents , data or other information of another marketparticipant to the extent such documents , data or information is to betreated as in accordance with section 20.3.2 ; provided , however , a marketparticipant may receive and review any composite documents , data , and otherinformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents , data , or information , if the composite document does not disclose suchconfidential data or information relating to an individual marketparticipant and provided , however , that the iso may disclose information asprovided for in its bylaws . 35 . part of the caiso tariff is the iso market monitoring & informationprotocol ( mmip ) . the objective of this protocol ( mmip ) is to set forth theworkplan and rules under which the iso will monitor the iso markets toidentify abuses of market power . the mmip part of the tariff applies to alliso market participants , including defendants .36 . mmip section 2.1.1 . states in relevant part : anomalous market behavior , which is defined as behavior that departssignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do notrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual orunexplained market outcomes . evidence of such behavior may be derived froma number of circumstances , including : mmip 2.1.1.1 withholding of generation capacity under circumstances inwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market ; mmip 2.1.1.2 unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability bygenerators ; mmip 2.1.1.3 unusual trades or transactions ; mmip 2.1.1.4 pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent withprevailing supply and demand conditions , e. g. , prices and bids that appearconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions ; andmmip 2.1.1.5 unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from orexports to other markets or exchanges . the market surveillance unit shall evaluate , on an ongoing basis , whetherthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates thepresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort theoperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market , e. g. , thestrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity , and whether it indicatesthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptablepractices .37 . mmip section 2.1.3 states in relevant part : "" gaming "" , or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forthin the px or iso tariffs , protocols or activity rules , or of transmissionconstraints in periods in which exist substantial congestion , to thedetriment of the efficiency of , and of consumers in , the iso markets . "" gaming "" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions thatmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity , such asloop flow , facility outages , level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from out-of-state , or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the iso markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency . 38 . market participants used their trade organization , the wscc , toshare access to and use real time information , notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the iso s operating procedures , as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by ferc , and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the px . those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitivebehavior.39 . it has been reported in the dow jones work . com newswire on october19 , 2000 , that : "" electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports fromthe state s grid operator to their advantage in california s wholesaleelectricity market , according to an official with the western systemscoordinating council . * * * * * * * "" at issue is real-time information the california independent systemoperator provided the western systems coordinating council , a governmental [ sic ] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernu . s. , about power plant activity in the state . "" the real-time information allows market participants . . . to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200megawatts has online at any given moment . . . . . "" the information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid . . . . "" last month , however , the iso s attorneys alerted the wscc that the data isbeing used against them and to game the market , according to bill commish , director of dispatch with the wscc . * * * * * * "" commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customers . "" however , the iso , which controls about 75 % of the state s power grid andreal-time market , may have violated a ferc rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for 90 days , an iso attorney told thewscc . "" beginning monday , the iso will no longer provide such information to thewscc or other market participants . "" 40 . starting on or about may 22 , 2000 , defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by , among other things , reducing their output , strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets , and exportingelectricity from the state in order to drive up the real time market priceand other market prices . as a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information , the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on may 22 , 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since . ferc , cpuc , and caiso dept. of market analysis , have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the caiso board .41 . as noted in the north county times on october 19 , 2000 : "" a case study of san diego county s two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in june , even as pricesskyrocketed and california s power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackouts . "" to the study s author . . . the low production in san diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in ca werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices . * * * * * * mccullough s hour-by-hour analysis of power output for june found that theencina plant in carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant s cost ofproduction . the south bay power plant in chula vista generated 61 percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theory . economists estimate it costs $ 45 - $ 55 per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants . the wholesale price in june averaged $ 120 permegawatt hour . a separate analysis conducted by the north county times revealed "" mysteriouscutbacks in carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices . "" * * ** * "" investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on california s marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production . "" "" we did see evidence of withholding in the bidding , according to jimdetmers , the iso s operations chief . "" 42 . in addition , defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the px in order to take advantage of the iso s need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod . in addition , certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in thecalifornia markets . they then sold that electricity back into thecalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created . these tactics forced buyers in the california wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than 30 % of their electricity needs in the inflated spotmarket , rather than the less than 5 % that should be sold in that market . thespot market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energy . c. results of defendants activities43 . from late may 2000 through the present , defendants activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels , well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity . those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by sdg & e , whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of sdg & e s costs for such power , which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the california power exchange .44 . as the market surveillance committee ( "" msc "" ) of the caiso concludedin its september 6 , 2000 report ( "" the msc report "" ) , during the months of mayand june 2000 revenues from the sale of iso loads in the california energymarket were 37 % and 182 % , respectively , above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions . msc report at p. 2 . the msc report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a "" significant amount of market power "" in the california energy markets , beginning as early as october 1999 and increasing dramatically during theclass period . id . at pp. 4 , 15 , 17.45 . the average market clearing price in california s wholesale marketsduring august of 2000 was $ 166.24 / mwh under moderate load conditions , compared with $ 32.31 / mwh a year earlier . while load demand conditions incalifornia during august 2000 were slightly higher than in august 1999 , theywere similar to those during august 1998 when prices were much lower . peakdemand in august 2000 was lower than in august of either of the prior twoyears , negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases . indeed , some california electricity producerswere only running at 60 % of capacity during the so-called emergency periods . 46 . these price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight , when electricity is abundant and demand is low . further , prices innovember 2000 , when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months , continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace .47 . as a result of defendants exercise of market power , theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits . as reported in the october 17 , 2000 san diego uniontribune , analyst anatol feygin of jp morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from california for the 3 months ended september 30 , 2000could reach $ 6 billion , even after taking into account cost increases . feygin stated , "" the industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year . . . . that is a fortune . "" 48 . defendant reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last year s figure by about $ 110 million . similarly , defendant dynegyreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income , ascompared to its third quarter 1999 figures . profits from defendantdynegy s wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to $ 141.9 million , which represented 80 percent of dynegy s overall profits . "" this is the most successful quarter in dynegy s history "" , reported chairmanand chief executive officer , charles chuck watson . other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period .49 . prior to deregulation , the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in san diego county was approximately $ 23-45 per mwh . during the summer of 2000 , defendants conduct caused the real time marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $ 750 per mwh , resultingin an approximate tripling of sdg & e customers bills .50 . in its order issued on november 1 , 2000 , ferc concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in california had been at "" unjust andunreasonable "" levels during the summer of 2000 . caiso and cpuc responses tothe november 1st ferc order both concluded that wholesale prices duringsummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders . 51 . plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity , including retail customersof sdg & e since costs were fully passed through to them . the cpuc s november22 , 2000 report to ferc concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a $ 4 billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to california during the summer of 2000 . due to theunlawful conduct alleged above , plaintiffs and the class paid approximately $ 4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have , causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses . ascongressman brian bilbray stated : "" every day that goes by you ve got smallbusinesses bleeding to death . people are literally dying financially fromthis situation . "" work . com newswire ( 10/21/00 ) .52 . the improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages , and other manipulative conduct , had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices abovecompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting tobillions of dollars , at the expense of plaintiffs and the class . first cause of action violation of sections 16720 and 16726 of the california business and professions code trust in restraint of trade or commerce in violation of theantitrust act ( against all defendants ) 53 . plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above .54 . the cartwright act states , at o16726 , that : "" except as provided inthis chapter , every trust is unlawful , against public policy and void .

james.d.steffes@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,"steve -- thanks . looks good . some thoughts for you to consider : 1 . not sure that impact # 1 makes sense to present . no real reason to set ctc = 0 c/kwh on jan 5 ( calpx was still in operation ) . i think that impact # 2 better captures the idea . also , probably not good to use the term "" ctc eliminated "" . maybe should say "" ctc = 0 c/kwh "" . given the cpuc s march 27 order , the utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until march 31 , 2002 . 2 . in calculating impact # 2 , what did you use as the jan 19 - aug baseline ? did you calculate the hit of ( $ 104.5 ) from actual bills or based on our dj index model ( there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline ) ? also , i assume that the feb - aug timeframe was relatively low because ees and eemc had most of their load on bundled service . 3 . probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for px credit calculation and most specifically the pg & e adjustment . also , may be interesting to have the $ impact of the pg & e adjustment ( the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake ) . i think that this is something we need to go into the cpuc to fight pretty quickly . 4 . should impact # 4 and impact # 5 apply to sce s loads ? in column 4 it looks like it does . sce is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge . 5 . probably better to model impact # 5 as of oct 1 not sept 1 . 6 . can you break out the volumes for "" vintage "" contracts versus "" retail gen with passthru "" contracts ? you haven t shown anything for ( a ) utility undercollection costs or ( b ) cdwr bond fees . these costs may hit our vintage contracts . jim ----- ",2001-08-23 05:37:58

[ our understanding is that neta completely reorganized the uk pool . the uk system now looks like a "" self-dispatch "" , physical rights model ] 8 ) as a follow up of the previous question : assuming alliance adopts a self-dispatch , physical rights approach similar to the one ng operates in the uk today . don t you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring rtos , considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch , lmp and financial rights for most rtos in the us ? 9 ) if your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch , lmp/financial rights , shouldn t some functions in your "" martix of rto functions "" be collapsed ? for example : management of congestion prices , calculation of congestion , operations of energy markets and generation redispatch ? 10 ) procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core . however , in the uk system , this represents a significant role of the transco , with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement . is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the rto and consequently will be part of the pbr formula ? 11 ) generation interconnection . obviously , your proposal did not go that far . conceptually , do you favor a system whereby t fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the uk model whereby fixed costs ( use of the system ) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component ( and connection costs are treates separately , according to a shallow method ? 12 ) establishment of transmission rates . how to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the transco itself will establish its t rates ? are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities ? 13 ) you stated that separation and control of t assets persists , to a large extent , in the collaborative model proposed as part of the southeast mediation . do you think that the independent system administration model is superior in this regard ? what are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",2001-11-21 09:43:48

( do we have any document which could substantiate this ? ) 2 ) although dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that epe runs full time ( with 300 mw available ) , there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring . [ please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how long this will take . i presume that furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures . ] 3 ) based on our analysis , the optimal operating approach would be to generate 220mw with one turbine and 91 mw with the other for a total of 311 if dipatched above 220 mw . if we can prove that 1 ) & 2 ) are correct or convince the lenders that they are , then i think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by april 01 . we will have to see how it looks when we add the sue garvin flex months . therefore , a merit order analysis is only necessary if i ) our supposition about furnas motivations are incorrect and/or ii ) the transmission problem is cleared . if this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a ) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or seasonal impacts , b ) due to scheduled outages , and c ) due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses . any data you can provide will be helpful . have i successfully connected the dots here?if you have previously sent these materials to felipe or tracee please simply grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me . remember , you don t have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something done . regards , rob",2000-12-19 01:51:00

thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit revisions for the transwestern pipeline compressor stations near kingman and flagstaff . we were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on the practical approach to improving arizona s air quality as promptly as possible . working with you and your team of cathy o connell and prabhat barghava gave our team from enron transportation services and transwestern pipeline company ( twp ) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation . following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities : 1 . by friday morning , october 5 , prabhat and shudeish mahadev will have completed the draft permits ; on friday afternoon , october 5 , the adeq team , including prabhat and cathy o connell , will conduct the internal review and the tsd ; by close of business , friday , october 5 , adeq will email the draft permits revisions to the twp team ( bill kendrick , larry campbell and me ;

adeq will promptly prepare the form of notice , unless you wish twp to do it .4 . on tuesday , november 13 , adeq will conduct the public hearing on the two permit revisions in williams az . we have found nothing in the statutes or rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the kingman and flagstaff facilities permits revisions in the same place .5 . promptly after the october 9 conference call that finalizes the draft permits revisions , adeq will send the drafts to epa region ix to commence epa s review . twp will confer with the epa contacts to shorten the maximum 45 days allowed so that epa will complete its review on or before thursday , november 15 ; epa will promptly notify adeq of its approval .6 . on the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the epa review generated any substantive comments that require further review , adeq will issue the permits revisions by friday , november 16 . we recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation among all parties , as well as working closely with epa , but we are confident , based upon yesterday s meeting , that all of us from adeq and from twp are committed to making this doable schedule work . the twp team will promptly convey to adeq all materials it receives relating to the epa permits revisions for the leupp and klagetoh facilities . we also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance . specifically , since there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing equipment and making the srubbers tie-ins , twp can proceed with those activities at the kingman and flagstaff sites . additionally , we can proceed with the off-site fabrication of piping . we also understand that , at the time of the first newspaper notices , we will post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices . again , thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing schedule and procedures . it is a real pleasure working together to improve arizona s air quality . sincerely yours , jerry d. martincc . cathy o connell prabhat bhargava steve burr van wolfi will aim to get this letter out the door by mid-day friday . vanthe information contained in this electronic mail message is confidential information intended only for the use of the individual or entity named above , and may be privileged . if the reader of this message is not the intended recipient or the employee or agent responsible to deliver it to the intended recipient , you are hereby notified that any dissemination , distribution or copying of this communication is strictly prohibited . if you have received this communication in error , please immediately notify us by telephone ( 602-382-6000 ) , and delete the ",2001-09-27 12:00:00

matthew.lenhart@enron.com, Jeffrey K Skilling@Enron,"mr. skilling-here are a few questions i would like to submit before your floor meeting on the 32nd floor wednesday .1 . ) enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets . is enron going to be just a trading company ? 2 . ) if enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile . how could this affect our stock price ? will wall street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings ? 3 . ) volume on eol seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place . is this going to have a negative effect on enron s stock price ? 4 . ) what are some of the new markets enron plans to explore in the near future ? 5 . ) is broadband coming along as quickly as wall st. expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband?i hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and i look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow . sincerely , matt lenhart",2000-10-31 07:26:00

chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,"today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction . deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1,000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing . -- chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1.5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1.5 billion in cash in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas . -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares . -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year . enron will have immediate access to dynegy s $ 1.5 billion cash investment in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary . management of newly formed companychuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc. , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo . i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron . management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined . the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we can not rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible . as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses . i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at < http://home . enron . com/updates / > . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions@enron . com <mailto:questions@enron . com > . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670 . i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse . and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron . investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec s web site at www . sec . gov. copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc. , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : (713) 507-6400 , fax : (713) 507-6808 ;

robert.bruce@enron.com,sara.shackleton@enron.com,"sara , i think the credit issues that i was going to have to address with russell have been resolved in that it looks like russell is just going to do a margin call on this counterparty ( north coast energy ) . however , i think these issues could come up again with other counterparties , and i think it might be beneficial to have a general meeting with credit to establish some guidelines ( especially since there are so many new people in credit ) . the issue , basically , is alternative ways of gaining comfort if we want to forego a margin call -- the north coast situation is a good example . north coast started as a simple isda amendment to raise the collateral threshold so that we wouldn t have to margin call . russell ( as he has on another deal ) asked to provide that north coast s substantial debt to its parent company be subordinated to us . as we were considering this arrangement , north coast s counsel called to tell us that they had just signed up a big bank line that they used to pay off the intercompany debt . he told us that the bank syndicate had also agreed , essentially , to let enron share secured creditor status with the bank group -- on the same debt priority level -- for up to $ 5 million on a pari passu basis . but i think russell felt that north coast had gotten over leveraged , and so it looks like he s going to do a margin call . i have tried to impress upon russell that gaining debt priority -- whether through an intercompany subordination agreement or pursuant to an arrangement described above -- is not a simple thing to effect legally . obviously , on this particular deal , we ve got too much on our plates in-house to spend time reviewing the 82-page loan agreement , negotiating intercreditor documents , and doing due diligence on the liens . i did tell russell that if north coast was willing to pay for outside counsel to do this for us , then i would have to ask you or mark taylor if we could go this route ( we never made this offer to the counterparty ) . it seems to me that there is a lot of potential for these situations to come up again . i would think that the rise in gas prices has resulted in a lot of exposures , and for business relationship purposes , we like to consider alternatives to margin call if the counterparty can come up with another way to give us comfort ( this afternoon i got a call from one of our marketers who was rather irate about the north coast margin call ) . if we are going to be considering alternatives like subordination or secured creditor status , i think it would be a good idea if we impressed upon everybody in credit that these arrangements are not achieved as easily as they are conceived , and that they will have to engage in a bit of cost-benefit analysis , and consider the logistics involved , before agreeing to these arrangements . let me know what you think . -- bobrobert e. brucesenior counselenron north america corp. t (713) 345-7780 f (713) 646-3393 robert . bruce@enron . com",2000-09-29 08:36:00

( i think every matrix i have used here has been part of a csa ) . rating ( s & p ) credit lineaa or above $ 20mmbbb + to aa - $ 15mmbbb $ 10mmbbb - $ 7mmbb - to bb + $ 5mmbelow bb - $ 1mmthese terms are subject to negotiation . once again , the matrix removes mac clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such , but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have ( or they have ) to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality . what do you all think?johnjonathan whitehead @ enron 09/25/2000 08:18 pmto : john suttle/hou/ect @ectcc : jane mcbride/ap/enron @enron , john viverito/corp/enron @enron , kevin cordesman/hou/ect @ect , mark taylor/hou/ect @ect , morten e pettersen/ap/enron @enron , steven kleege/hou/ect @ect , tom bruce-jones/lon/ect @ect subject : re : fw : ibj isda master agreement sorry , pressed send too early : john , have had a conversation with ibj re the csa , and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a csa . i propose to meet with them again to try and explore why , but i would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we don t enter into a csa , and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with ibj . my feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions ( over 2 years ) at this stage anyway , and would prefer to get the relationship going , as i am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet . they appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points . we can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals . i also want to keep the loan facility completely separate . what are your thoughts on this , and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a csa?thanks , jonathan john viverito 09/22/2000 12:04 pm to : john suttle/hou/ect @ect cc : jane mcbride/ap/enron @enron @ect , john viverito/corp/enron @enron @ect , jonathan . whitehead@enron . com , kevin cordesman/hou/ect @ect , mark taylor/hou/ect @ect , morten e pettersen/ap/enron @enron @ect , steven kleege/hou/ect @ect , tom bruce-jones/lon/ect @ect subject : re : fw : ibj isda master agreementjohn-during our last meeting with ibj , we pushed hard for the implementation of the csa . i believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the csa , as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties . we expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call . ibj informed us that they have never entered into a csa with a non-financial institution counterparty and my response was that enron can then be the first . we requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors . as you know , their response to our discussions relating to this issue was "" in terms of csa , as we are not ready for running collateral operations , we still do not prefer to use the csa . "" the legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different , including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a csa with a non-financial institution . we will continue to attempt to persuade ibj to enter into the csa with enron , however it is uncertain if this is achievable .",2000-11-27 10:54:00

( oil changes , minor maintenance , tune-ups and tire repair ) because enron is now organized under egs , we have an opportunity to support the recommendations of the enron fleet council . as you are aware , the council recommended purchasing vehicles based upon the manufacturer s incentives and stacking volumes based on total enron purchases . we only requested incentives from the manufacturers based on the 300 level because we have such a split of purchasing practices across the business units . rather than the 300 level , we would be looking at 450 to 500 with even greater incentives . we have an opportunity to reduce enron s overall fleet costs by making a decision to utilize one manufacturer , rather than splitting the purchases between all three manufacturer s. because we are now organized under one cfo within enron global services , this may be an opportunity to guide all enron business units to take advantage of our purchasing power . this recommendation will be challenged by some business units , but under these challenging times within enron , any savings in our costs effects the bottom line . the enron fleet council will collectively offer additional savings based on sound fleet practices , during the next few weeks . if you have any questions , please don t hesitate to call . regards , bruce a. martinfleet managerenron transportation servicesthree allen center 3ac3283333 clay streethouston , texas 77002713-345-6527 phone713-858-1023 cell800-376-8768 pager or 8003768768@skytel . com281-664-4567 cynet fax",2001-11-05 19:24:02

"" within five years , the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets , "" he says . "" so for us , it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business . "" that s currently a $ 35 billion business . but critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas , especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications . and critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity , they might prefer to do it through some channel that s independent of the control of a single market maker like enron . "" enron s argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator , and that it need not have deep telecom expertise , "" says lisa pierce , an analyst at giga information group in stamford , conn. "" but i m not convinced it s that simple . technology isn t a long-term competitive differentiator . "" houston-based enron broadband services inc. , formed last year , offers ip transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network . enron broadband services also trades - that is , makes a market by buying and selling - network capacity to and from other data carriers , conducting some of the transactions on enrononline . enron broadband services also offers content-oriented services , such as a video-on-demand service it will market with dallas-based blockbuster inc. to home viewers starting next month . "" when we started the gas business , they told us we were nuts , "" skilling says . "" they said , you re going to sell gas but not own production ? how does that work ? then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again , and even louder than before . they said this stuff moves at the speed of light ; you can never create a market . then in telecommunications , they said we were nuts again . "" despite its share of skeptics , some experts like enron s prospects in this space . "" i think aspects of this have the potential to be very big , "" says libby . "" the carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning . and i think it has a lot of potential [ for ] . . . selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it . "" "" we aspire to that kind of model , "" says fred buehler , director of electronic business at eastman chemical co. in kingsport , tenn. "" in every sector , there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value , "" buehler says . "" we re trying to be one of them . "" market maker stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of enron s glistening 50-story headquarters , and the company s technological sophistication is immediately evident . traders like 26-year-old john arnold , who personally executes about $ 1 billion per day in trades , have real-time access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second buy-and-sell decisions . that information might be a meteorologist s prediction of a colder-than-normal winter across the plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oil-producing country in the middle east . behind the scenes , all of arnold s trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated , proprietary risk-management system and then updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide . less than a year after launching the operation , 60 % of the world s gas is traded on enrononline . "" what we are doing , no one in the industry did 10 years ago . eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didn t exist 10 years ago , "" says skilling . for example , enrononline contributed heavily to its parent company s third-quarter earnings , which were up 31 % to $ 292 million , compared with the same period last year . "" the change is technology-driven , "" skilling adds . "" we couldn t do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability . "" in this regard , enron joins a short list of companies that includes wal-mart stores inc. , fedex corp. and american airlines inc. , which famously pioneered various mission-critical it techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of it-enabled industry leaders . among enron s boldest ideas is its use of a single , powerful software-based trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets . currently , enron trades more than 1,000 different commodities , such as gold , natural gas and metals , on enrononline . "" the core of our business is our business model , which is a centralized risk-management and market-making business model . it just so happens that the internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model , "" skilling says . but as a market maker , enrononline stands alone . for starters , unlike most other internet marketplaces , it s free . there are no transaction fees or catalog , inventory or subscription costs for users . "" enron has broken away from the pack in the last year , in terms of their capital growth , "" says ian wylie , vice president of e-business at bp amoco plc in london . "" and e-business is responsible for a lot of this change . "" even more unusual is enron s role as a principal in each transaction . that means enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it s involved , unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers . in fact , skilling , as well as mike mcconnell , who heads enrononline s global expansion efforts as president and ceo of enron global markets llc , dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan . "" [ many of the ] b2b guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting , but it doesn t work that way , "" skilling says . "" you need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove . "" as either the seller or buyer in all of its trades , enron , an established brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets , guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on enrononline . "" we re creating markets that were highly illiquid , so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say , we ll deliver , "" skilling says . but guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants . guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity . for enron , this is where the bricks and mortar come in . for example , to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market , enron paid $ 72 million in july for garden state paper co. , a recycled-newsprint mill in garfield , n. j. skilling s current market fancy is metals , and in may , enron bought mg plc , a london-based metals marketer . "" you have to break the liquidity logjam , and to do that , you have to take a risk position , "" skilling says . but once the logjam is cleared , enron is just as likely to sell off the brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business . for example , to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation , enron is selling portland general electric co. , a portland , ore.-based power producer that it bought in 1997 , so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market . eventually , enron may end up trading commodities that aren t even considered commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space . "" might we move into sauces or meats or grains ? potentially , "" says mcconnell , who was enron s de facto cio before moving into his current role . "" you have to be creative every day , "" mcconnell says . "" you have to be open-minded to trying new things . "" but what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is enron s core it-enabled business model , which is what puts it in a class of its own , analysts say . "" people have talked a lot about systems that they re about to roll out , but there is just not much out there for direct trading , "" says mike heim , an energy analyst at a. g. edwards & sons inc. in st. louis . "" enron rolled out its technology 10 months ago , and still there isn t much else out there . there hasn t been much competition [ because ] there isn t anybody in the same class . "" but just last month , houston-based dynegy inc. launched dynegydirect , an internet-based , commission-free trading site for energy and communications commodities . also last month , intercontinentalexchange in atlanta , whose partners include bp amoco and the hague-based royal dutch/shell group , added natural gas and power to its online trading system , which already included precious metals and crude oil . skilling doesn t get called "" nuts "" much anymore . in fact , he s a darling on wall street , where enron s stock has soared from around $ 40 per share last november to $ 81 as of this nov. 2 . as a result , enron - by all accounts , an old economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as a new economy pioneer . says skilling , "" we like to say we were b2b before there was b2b . "" thriving on the unconventional as head of two enron pipeline subsidiaries , mike mcconnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from enron president and chief operating officer jeff skilling . recalls mcconnell , "" jeff went into this whole thought process about how the internet is changing everything . he said , we need to make enron an e-business , and i need a guy that can run this as a business . we need to change the way we view technology . "" i thought he was a little crazy and i said , jeff , i m not a technology person at all , he said , no , seriously - this is going to be big . so i took over as ceo of enron global technology , "" and thus became the company s de facto cio , mcconnell explains . appointing a person with no technology background to the top it post is an unusual move . but enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result . indeed , enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that s unusual in large , long-established companies , and in utilities firms in particular . mcconnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old louise kitchen , enron s head gas trader in europe , spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading system , recruiting it people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work . word of the web-based platform , enrononline , which is literally remaking the company , didn t reach top management until a few weeks before it went live . kitchen enlisted the support of enron s initially skeptical top traders , and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts . her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs . "" it s an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy , "" mcconnell says . "" no one went to the board and said , we want to change the way we trade . you just do it . "" glowing endorsement soon after mcconnell became the de facto cio of the $ 40 billion energy company , he joined eight of sun microsystems inc. s top houston customers at a breakfast hosted by sun ceo scott mcnealy . "" i was very nervous , "" recalls mcconnell , 40 . "" i mean , mcnealy is the guy , and here i know nothing about technology . i d been on the job maybe two weeks . "" mcnealy asked the attendees - all but mcconnell were middle-aged cios with many years of it experience - to introduce themselves in turn . "" when scott came to me , i said , i m the ceo of global technology , and we want to be the leader in b2b commerce in the world . he kind of sat back and said , how long have you been in the it business ? "" mcconnell explains . "" about nine days , i said , and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology . scott chuckled and said , that sounds like enron ; it always looks at things differently . he then stated that my ceo title and enron s approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon , as this was the way of the future . "" mcconnell says mcnealy s endorsement had "" a huge impact "" on how he structured it at enron during the following year . "" i realized that we weren t too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology , "" he says - a view of it as an integral part of the business , not as something that supports business functions . "" none of the other companies were thinking our new way at all . "" taking a commercial view of it has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates it organizations from the business units they support . when mcconnell became ceo of global technology , enron had five cios who were predominantly operating independently inside the company s major lines of business . "" each cio had his own agenda , his own thought process , his own goals , and they did not communicate at all , "" he says . mcconnell established corporate standards for it , created a management team that included the five cios and put all it people under a new chief technology officer , philippe bibi . but it is far from centralized at enron . "" we wanted to make people think about technology not as it and support , but as an extension of your business , "" he explains . "" so we seeded people out into the business units . [ it ] directs the performance review process , but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated . "" firms like enron that merge it departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses , says it organization expert robert zawacki , president of zawacki and associates in colorado springs and a professor emeritus at the university of colorado , also in colorado springs . "" we need more entrepreneurial leaders in it , and [ mcconnell ] is certainly one , "" he says . it makes it easier to be entrepreneurial , says mcconnell , who is now president and ceo of enron global markets . "" we really do like to try things and see what happens , and when you have an electronic platform like [ enrononline ] that we can model into different sectors , it s very inexpensive to try it . we are not afraid ; if it s not working , we ll just stop .

"" it just shows we re paying too much for energy now , "" said nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network . hoge said the company financial report , which shows a $ 4.3 billion cash balance , strengthens the group s claim that pacific gas & electric co. s bankruptcy filing in april was unnecessary to pay off the utility s debts . hertzog said the third-quarter generation profit pales in comparison to the losses pg & e sustained last winter when power prices skyrocketed and the utility was prevented by a rate freeze from passing on the costs to consumers . the company wrote off $ 9 billion in unpaid costs , though it is suing to force the puc to allow the utility to recover the money from ratepayers . terrie prosper , a spokeswoman for the puc , said pg & e corp. may not get to keep the $ 687 million . "" the quarterly statement reflects money that pg & e corp. is collecting that the puc hasn t decided how to allocate . "" energy price probes widen to include state officials / chief of power grid to be questioned in june , as californians braced for a summer of rolling blackouts , television cameras captured allegations from former duke energy employees that seemed to pin the state s energy mess on power providers . the self-described whistleblowers told a legislative committee that duke withheld power during the peak of california s electricity shortage to boost prices , charges the company denied . but more than four months later and at a cost that could top $ 10 million , state-sponsored investigations into the energy crisis have yielded no civil or criminal penalties against power providers . in fact , some probes started to scrutinize energy companies are now targeting other big players in the california energy market : state officials . investigators are looking into a range of accusations , from why the head of the state power grid helped open the flood gates to massive electricity price hikes to new complaints that the state department buying power is manipulating the market . under subpoena , terry winter , who runs the california independent system operator , will be deposed today in the state capitol . the new questions have broadened the scope of the investigations into who the real culprit is in the state s electricity crisis . "" who s the bad guy ? the better question is who is wearing the white hat ? "" said gary ackerman , spokesman for the western power trading forum , a trade group representing generators . when california blackouts became a punchline for late-night comedians , several state agencies began investigations : -- attorney general bill lockyer announced he was investigating price-gouging by generators . he convened a grand jury in june to discover whether generators had purposely withheld power to the market to drive up prices . -- the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation was created by the legislature . run by sen. joe dunn , d-santa ana , the committee hosted the duke whistle-blowers and issued a flurry of subpoenas for records kept by energy providers . -- the public utilities commission also began looking into the market and into allegations that generators had idled plants at key times . all three investigations are continuing . the puc has spent more than $ 800,000 on its review , lockyer has $ 9 million to spend on his work and dunn s committee is spending about $ 14,000 per month . lockyer has said he is looking into complaints that energy consultants hired by gov. gray davis had conflicts of interest . one consultant allegedly helped negotiate a long-term energy contract with an electricity provider he had recently worked for . the state s fair political practices commission and the u. s. securities and exchange commission are also exploring conflict-of - interest charges that led davis to fire five consultants . dunn s committee is still looking into market manipulation by generators . but he has spent more time recently investigating the actions of state officials . dunn wants to know why the head of the iso , winter , asked federal regulators on dec. 8 to drop caps on the price companies could charge for power . winter made his pitch to the federal energy regulatory committee without telling davis or his bosses , the 26-person iso board that had regularly voted for strict price caps . the committee quickly approved winter s request , and energy prices began soaring . while iso officials contend winter had to kill price caps to keep generators interested in selling power to the state , dunn is looking into whether winter and the generators somehow colluded to drive up prices . iso officials deny that winter worked with generators to drop price caps . "" it seems ludicrous that terry winter wouldn t tell his bosses that he was about to take the boldest step in iso history , "" dunn said . dunn s committee also is probing recent complaints from generators that the state is manipulating the energy market . the state department of water resources , which began buying power in january after cash-strapped utilities no longer could , is demanding exclusive information about the power market from the iso , generators allege . the department also has refused to pay generators for electricity it s buying unless it s told what generators costs are . that information could lead to one of the biggest buyers in the market -- the state -- with more data than other competitors , creating an unfair playing field , generators argue . while a dwr spokesman said the department is working with generators to address their concerns , the generators have asked federal regulators to step in . but dunn said he ll investigate whatever group is wreaking havoc in the energy market . "" if those allegations are true , we now have a market participant exercising an undue influence on the market , "" he said . "" they re doing the same things the generators were accused of . "" pg & e re-evaluating new construction of pwr plants - execslos angeles - ( dow jones ) - pg & e corp ( pcg ) is re-evaluating how much new generation it will build in future years due to declining market demand and the impact of utility pacific gas and electric co s bankrutpcy , company executives said on an earnings call with analysts monday . "" previously we have said we will have 22,000 megawatts in 2004 , "" said tom boren , president and ceo of pg & e corp s national energy group unit . "" that s still being evaluated so we can t give new projections , but it s likely to be less than 22,000 mw . "" the company will proceed with the construction of current projects worth 5,400 mw , and tolling arrangements worth 2,200 , boren added . "" we are not cancelling development projects at this time , and we are also moving forward with construction of the north baja ( natural gas ) pipeline , "" boren said . the company s re-evaluation of how much generation it will build has more to do with the outlook of future market conditions than the condition of the company itself , boren said . he declined to say if the company was reconsidering projects in a certain area of the country in particular . boren made his statements during a conference call on the company s third-quarter earnings . as reported , the company s quarterly net income more than tripled , but earnings excluding items increased just 3.2 % and missed wall street forecasts . though the company expects to see an 8-10 % growth in earnings per share from operations , several executives said that 2002 will be a "" challenging transition year "" . several controversial regulatory and legal steps needed to implement the utility s plan of reorganization under its chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings will be put to the test in 2002 , said pg & e corp chair , ceo and president bob glynn . "" it will be a transition year from our current organization to our post-plan-of-reorganization structure ... there s not a member among us who thinks it will all be smooth sailing . the utility is already facing adverse regulatory decisions and the energy group is facing reduced forward prices for power , "" glynn said . the utility filed a reorganization plan in september that would transfer all the utility s transmission and generating assets to unregulated subsidiaries , then spin off pacific gas and electric as a publicly-traded retail distributor of electricity and natural gas . one immediate challenge facing pacific gas and electric is tuesday s ballot measures in san francisco to create a municipal power district . if the measures succeed , the utility would lose 8 % of its customers . "" the utility is strongly opposed to the ballot initiatives . if they pass , there will be years and years of litigation , "" said chris warner , regulatory counsel for pg & e. "" the initiatives wouldn t affect the bankruptcy court s jurisdiction or schedule , however . "" the utility is scheduled to explain its disclosure statement on the reorganization plan before a federal bankruptcy judge dec. 19 . if the judge approves the statement , it will be mailed to creditors for a vote . if it passes muster , another court hearing will be held to confirm the plan . creditors seem to favor the plan , and , therefore , the company isn t seeking any alternative , such as a settlement reached between state regulators and california s other financially troubled utility , edison international ( eix ) unit southern california edison , a pg & e executive said . socal edison s settlement of a federal lawsuit with the california public utilities commission will allow it to bill its customers for $ 3.3 billion in debt and repay creditors using cash on hand . pg & e has filed a similar federal lawsuit against the commission claiming it has the right to raise retail rates to recover power costs . that lawsuit is on hold while the court determines how it interacts with a related decision made in bankruptcy court , said utility ceo and president gordon smith . another pending matter for the utility is a determination by the department of water resources of how much revenue it will need from the utility through 2002 to pay for power purchases . the dwr has been buying power on behalf of the state s credit-strapped utilities since january . pacific gas and electric has been paying an interim price of 10 cents a kilowatt hour since march for that dwr power . "" we re expecting a revised revenue requirement from the dwr as early as today , "" warner said . "" the last announcement on oct. 19 was that the overall requirement had shrunk by $ 2.5 billion , so we expect the requirement will go down accordingly for each utility . "" no one at the dwr was immediately available to comment on the status of the revenue requirement . san francisco to vote on public power san francisco , nov 5 ( reuters ) - after a year which saw california s energy system thrown into unprecedented turmoil , san francisco votes on tuesday on two proposals to establish a public power agency to take over the functions of struggling utility giant pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) . the two ballot initiatives , measure f and measure i , aim to make san francisco the latest city in the country to set up a municipal utility district ( mud ) - a potential blow to pg & e , which still serves some 4.7 million customers in northern and central california despite having declared bankruptcy in april at the height of the state s power crisis . backed by businesses ranging from garbage companies to telecommunications firms that fear they could also be targeted by voters eager to take charge of their own city services , pacific gas & electric has spent more than $ 1 million in an aggressive advertising campaign which describes the mud idea as unrealistic and inefficient . but supporters of the mud proposals ranging from environmental activists to consumer groups say the time has come for san francisco to fashion a utility district that is a nonprofit public entity rather than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm . "" the profit that is generated by the sale , transmission and management of electricity , is realized back into the rate structure , "" said ross mirkarimi , campaign manager for the group supporting the mud proposals . "" our utility ratepayers in san francisco will see lower rates in a very quick period of time while we move from being an abused renter of a neglecting landlord like pg & e to owning our own infrastructure . "" the battle over san francisco s mud proposals - which local pollsters say are running neck-and-neck - takes place after months of chaos as california s energy deregulation effort unexpectedly resulted in skyrocketing wholesale power prices , periodic blackouts , sharply higher consumer rates and financial crisis for the state s major utilities . reliable , affordable energy pacific gas & electric , a division of pg & e corp. , declared bankruptcy in april after running up billions of dollars in unpaid wholesale energy bills . the utility continues to function , however , and has repeatedly said it intends to use the bankruptcy process to put its finances in order . the mud proposal could threaten that plan . under proposition f , san francisco would create a power agency run by a governing board , while proposition i calls for san francisco and the neighboring town of brisbane to establish a municipal utility district with an elected board of directors . that board would then consider whether or not san francisco should take over pg & e s power transmission and distribution system in the city , as well as the city s small generating facilities owned by pg & e and mirant corp . supporters say a mud would deliver reliable , affordable energy , pointing to existing municipal utility districts in sacramento , los angeles and other california cities as examples of how public power can shield consumers from the increasingly wild swings of deregulated energy markets . opponents of the measure say it would thrust san francisco into a role it is ill-equipped to play - developing a new city bureaucracy and then sending it out to compete with big league energy players in the the fast-paced and often cutthroat world of the power markets . unlike established muds , san francisco would not only have to buy the city s existing power infrastructure - at a cost of anywhere up to $ 1 billion - but might also find itself jockeying for power without the benefit of long-term contracts which have kept consumer rates low in places like sacramento . despite the jitters in the business community , the mud proposal is backed by a number of major state and local political leaders as well as organized labor . passage of one or both of the mud proposals tuesday does not guarantee that san francisco would see a public power system established any time soon . pg & e has promised a court fight against any attempts by the city to seize its power infrastructure by eminent domain , meaning the measures could end up tangled in lengthy legal argument .",2001-11-06 07:28:00

people = 01 , s republic of california @@@ the iso replies to the eob reportseveral of you people commented to me that the iso = 01 , s reply to thepuc/eob report was very good . i decided to excerpt the best sections ofit for the burrito . the full document can be found on the iso = 01 , swebsite . = 01 & ... the [ puc/eob ] report asserts that the suspected activities ofcertain generators on june 13 created frequency instability leading tothe bay area blackouts the following day . in fact , the events of june 13and june 14 were completely independent of one another . the voltageinstability on june 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads , insufficient generation in the specificlocal area , and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofgeneration from outside the area . = 01 & the report states that the iso = 01 & never tried = 018 to call upon consume = rs toreduce demand in order to avoid the bay area blackouts . in fact , the isohad in place on june 14 a number of demand response programs designed toreduce load including the summer 2000 demand response program , underwhich customers have agreed , through a prior solicitation , to curtailenergy use in exchange for a fee = 01 & the report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by = 01 + purchasers = 01 , of energy as a result of the recent price spikes ( e. g. $ = 1.2 billion in the month of june alone ) . these assertions leave one with themistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bythe udcs and/or passed through to customers . however , in determining thetotal cost of energy , one must determine the impact of any forwardcontracts entered into by the udcs in advance of the wholesale energymarkets . these contracts , which are designed to = 01 & lock-in = 018 a specificprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities , arespecifically designed to mitigate the

in a similar vein , the reports asserts that california = 01 & might well == 018have saved $ 110 million dollars had a $ 250 price cap been in place inmay and june . this assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldhave been made at or below the $ 250 bid cap . in fact , during times ofpeak demand , when all of the state = 01 , s generation has been exhausted , theiso competes with neighboring regions for available generation . in orderto secure the necessary power , the iso must purchase , on a bilateralbasis , this energy from resources located outside of the iso = 01 , s controlarea . = 01 & the report asserts that california power markets = 01 & are not nowcompetitive = 018 and implies , erroneously in our view , that this is thenormal state of affairs . it is not . the market surveillance committeehas noted that = 01 & market power in the california energy market appears toariseprimarily during periods of peak demand , = 018 and warned that demand growthwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000 . = 01 & the report asserts that the iso is answerable only to a self-interestedboard and not to the citizens of california . this simply is not thecase . the iso is subject to the provisions of the federal power act andto the rules and regulations of ferc , which dictate , in part , thatwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicinterest . the iso further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andapproved by ferc . every change to our market design and virtually everyaspect of the iso = 01 , s business is subject to review and scrutiny by ferc . the ferc process provides substantial opportunities for input by thestate agencies and such agencies have , in fact , been active participantsin the ferc proceedings . = 01 & the report asserts that california supply conditions have been affectedby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madecalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages . this assertion isunfounded . significant load growth in california and neighboring statescoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothgeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability . restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold . only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willthis significant shortage be addressed . = 018 >> > things in the people = 01 , s republic of california @@@ reflections on a day of senate hearingsif you want to imagine a scary sight , imagine , then , twelve californialegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongsof electric restructuring . also imagine , as if you are in the twilightzone , witnesses that are slow on their feet , and reckless in theirfacts . then you get a glimpse of what yesterday = 01 , s joint senate/assemblyhearing was like . it started over two hours late . the senate was busy congratulating oneof their own who is term-limited out next session , and they wanted toheap on the glory . that said , the show began with cec commissioner billkeese . mr. keese has one story , and regardless how well he tells it , and he does , it is always the same story . it is the heat storm story . one can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is asingle-mom , call her lady-bird bowen , who travels across an angry landwith her precocious pre-teen child , stevie wonderboy . they aresearching for electric power plants in the dessert , which , by the graceof god have been shipped to other countries which have more liberalreturns on investment . being the first speaker , mr. keese took at least half the heat ( storm ) of the day . the rage of the energy fuhrer was palpable . last week , sandiegans shed 350 mw of load last week to save the entire system , and didnot receive one penny of compensation ( i = 01 , m not making that up ... hesaid it ) . he is sick of hearing about demand management as being asolution for the problem over the last five years , and he is about donelistening . people in san diego are depressed by the sudden pricehikes . yikes!keese did mention that the california reserve margin has sunk to 7 % , butin neighboring arizona , the reserve margin is -1 % or -2 % !! mr. keesecorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a californiaproblem , it is a regional problem . one member of the committee askedwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting andconstruction process?keese referred to governor gray davis = 01 , executive order issued last weekto which the cec plans to respond soon , date uncertain , that lays out a6 month permitting time line . the six months are enough if theapplicant has the land secured , zoning okayed , transmission access , andair offsets . hmmmmmm . that alone might take six months before you getto the cec . the next panel included mr. kahn of the eob , and ms. lynch . i went toohard on her last week , calling her let = 01 , s do lynch . that was a 0.8 tpc . sorry . i promise to be nicer starting now . the energy fuhrerinstructed ms. lynch to use her authority to order sdg & e to divert thepass through of funds from the customers to the px until the dysfunctionof the market is cured . put it in an escrow account . ms lynch promisedto review this option at her august 21 puc meeting where she will enactsdg & e rate caps ( told you ) . the star of the day , i thought , was ferc general counsel doug smith . mr. smith comes to sacramento . isn = 01 , t that a switch ? mr. smith came inplace of mr. hoecker , thank the lord . mr. smith put into ferc-eese whatthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way . the 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for ferc to declare thewholesale market as non-competitive , and then ask the generators to giveback the money they over collected . when can we do that ? mr. smithanswered as only a ferc attorney can answer . there is a process . ittakes time . you must have evidence . ferc uses a three-part criteriafor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable . it = 01 , sbased on market concentration and dominance , not the existence of highprices . you would have to sue ferc in federal court , and the best youcould hope for is for ferc to reconsider its decision upon remand fromthe us court of appeals . slowly , the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12 . they werestumped . herr ( hair ? ) peace screamed , couldn = 01 , t you , mr. smith of ferc , today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive , thatgenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power , andretro-actively implement a $ 250 rate cap across the western region?like a wheezing accordion , mr. smith played back and forth the familiarstrains of music , like a solo street musician on the corner . back andforth : the process , the process , the process . there have been times inthe past i hated the process at ferc . today , i have a renewed respectfor what process affords me and you ... freedom from the tyranny of amob . for the remainder of the hearing , they focused on remedies that could beundertaken by the puc . >> > things in the people = 01 , s republic of california @@@

( dan issending me a couple of relevant ferc documents now , but i will not beable to review them in detail until tuesday or wednesday . ) in general , however , it is fair to say that a common set of analytic errorsunderlies such bureaucratic thinking , and the dangers inherent in theiso and ferc orders suggest that a detailed refutation is something thatought to be done . the central points that i believe i would makeinclude the following , among others . ( i m using a small amount ofeconomic jargon here that i would not use in a report , but i really amquite experienced at making such arguments in plain english . ) 1 . such analyses typically are incomplete , in that they ignore ( a ) arisk premium for non - or under - or late payment . they ignore also ( b ) the fact that part of the marginal cost of selling today is the forgoneopportunity to sell tomorrow , given that units have to be taken down formaintenance and the like . in this sense , electricity can be "" stored "" inthe form of dispatch availability , and it is in the interest ofconsumers for suppliers to produce when supplies are needed the most , i. e. , when ( expected ) prices are highest . this is true even during astage 3 alert : suppose , for example , that even greater problems areforeseen for the ensuing summer . accordingly , this is not "" manipulation . "" in addition , as explained in my paper in the currentissue of regulation , ( c ) market prices under competition include a pricepremium for the provision of optimal reliability . these threecomponents of cost are important , with measurement requiring econometricand other tools ; and they perhaps are impossible to "" verify "" inregulatory methodology . 2 . the iso and ferc analyses confuse marginal and ( average ) variablecost , average and marginal producers , average and marginal units ofproduction , etc . other errors are likely as well : the iso , and , isuspect , ferc implicitly assume away rising input prices as demandconditions increase . this would yield in perfectly competitive marketsa supply curve steeper and a market price higher than measured "" marginalcost . "" moreover , the iso , and , again , ferc in all probability , implicitly assume perfectly elastic supply at whatever input "" costs "" happen to prevail . that is simply incorrect : in the short run , production capacity is limited , so that even if input prices do not risewith demand , there is a "" kink "" in the competitive supply curve . ifdemand intersects supply above the kink = 02 = 05that is , if the amount demande = dexceeds production capacity at the "" marginal cost "" that the regulatorsmeasure = 02 = 05price will exceed that "" marginal cost . "" think about thewholesale market for wheat , for example , which is close to a perfectlycompetitive market . in the face of bad weather in some agriculturalregions , the market price of wheat will rise , even though "" costs "" forthe remaining wheat farmers = 02 = 05labor , insecticide , land rents , fuel , wate = r , etc. = 02 = 05will not have changed , and indeed might actually fall because ofreduced demand from farmers affected by the adverse weather . 3 . the iso report admits explicitly that it does not know marketmarginal cost , because it complains that some suppliers bidding abovethe "" soft cap "" have not submitted cost data . moreover , marginal costproperly defined is for the market as a whole , rather than just for theproducers who bid in california . this means , quite literally , evenapart from all of the other problems , that the conclusion of "" uncompetitiveness "" or "" unreasonableness "" can not follow from the isoanalysis or from what is likely to be the underlying ferc analysis , because price will equal the marginal cost ( defined correctly ) of thelast unit produced in a competitive market . in short : the sort ofanalysis offered by the iso and ferc can not even in principle determinecompetitive prices because the regulators lack data for marginal costfor the marginal producer . 4 . the implicit definition of consumer welfare ( "" wellbeing "" ) usedby most regulators is incorrect . consumers are interested not in lowelectricity prices alone , but in a maximization of the value of theentire consumption basket . average electricity prices lower thanmarginal cost reduce consumer welfare by engendering resource use in theelectricity sector that is too big , and thus prices in other sectorsthat are too high . moreover , price controls of whatever form mustcreate shortages even in markets with inelastic demand , and the trueprice with a shortage is unambiguously higher than the price that wouldclear the market in the absence of the controls . ( think about the "" cost "" of electricity during a blackout . ) this is easy to demonstrateanalytically . the iso and ferc clearly are shunting aside the effects of pricecontrols masquerading as "" refunds "" upon long run expectations and otherparameters , which easily can be shown to make consumers worse off overtime . part of this problem is the creation of an asymmetricdistribution of expected returns , since suppliers clearly will not besubsidized when prices are low . 5 . the iso errs in its assumption that bids above the soft capreflect higher capital costs . i would not be surprised if ferc ismaking a similar error . capital costs , having been sunk , can not affectshort run pricing ; the differing engineering efficiencies of generatingunits will be reflected in their market values , and thus the opportunitycost of production . this means , in a strict textbook sense , thatdifferent generating units can not have costs that differ , ascounterintuitive as that sounds . more efficient units will have lowerfuel costs ( for example ) , but higher opportunity costs for employment ofthe capital assets . i would make this point in a report , simply toerode the credibility of the regulators , but i would not push it toohard , since some people can not understand it . 6 . the report ignores the market power of the respective regulatorybodies as monopsonists under the implicit system of price controls andrefunds . 7 . the definition of "" market power "" is entirely obscure , exceptimplicitly as bids higher than marginal cost as measured by theregulators . this is incorrect , and i think that this needs to beexplained clearly . i am sure that other errors and omissions will emerge as therelevant documents and arguments are reviewed . anyway , i d like toprepare such a report . i would have to see precisely what it is thatmust be refuted , but my guess is that this is about a two-week projectin terms of required analytic and writing time . an effort to measuremarginal cost correctly would be a good deal more involved andtime-consuming , and my sense is that at this stage a refutation is moreimportant . if it is a two-week project , then i think that $ 15,000 wouldbe reasonable . looking forward to hearing from you . ben",2001-03-13 01:51:00

no.address@enron.com, All Enron Worldwide@ENRON,"today , we announced our third quarter earnings results , which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $ 0.43 . this marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year , which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines . in addition , we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $ 0.45 for the fourth quarter ( $ 1.80 for 2001 ) and $ 2.15 for 2002 . we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enron s business strategy and performance , so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter . over the past few months , we have met with analysts to discuss enron s performance . we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units . in response to that feedback , we have provided results separately for several of our business units . for example , while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe , this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities . in addition , information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services . this quarter they are reported separately . finally , even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services , we are continuing to report that business separately . following are the highlights of our businesses : wholesale services : total income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) increased 28 % to $ 754 million in the third quarter . total wholesale physical volumes increased 65 % to 88.2 trillion british thermal units equivalent per day ( tbtue/d ) . americas : ibit increased 31 % to $ 701 million . natural gas volumes increased 6 % to 26.7 tbtu/d , and power volumes increased 77 % to 290 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) . europe and other commodity markets : ibit remained unchanged at $ 53 million as compared to last year . while physical gas and power volumes increased , low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat . retail services : enron energy services reported ibit of $ 71 million , compared to $ 27 million a year ago . so far this year , ees has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers . transportation and distribution : natural gas pipelines : ibit increased slightly to $ 85 million in the third quarter . portland general : we reported an ibit loss of $ ( 17 ) million this quarter compared to ibit of $ 74 million a year ago . this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter . last week , we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural . this transaction is expected to close next year . global assets : this segment includes elektro , dabhol , tgs , azurix and enron wind . third quarter ibit remained unchanged at $ 19 million compared to last year . broadband services : ibit losses were $ ( 80 ) million in the current quarter compared to a $ ( 20 ) million loss last year . this quarter s results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs . corporate and other : this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions . this segment reported an ibit loss of $ ( 59 ) million compared to $ ( 106 ) million a year ago . in addition , this quarter we announced one-time charges of $ 1.01 billion . over the past few quarters , we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses . these charges include : ? a $ 287 million write-down of azurix corp. ? $ 183 million associated with the restructuring of broadband services . this includes severance costs , a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers , and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers . ? $ 544 million related to losses from certain investments , primarily enron s interest in the new power company , broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement . with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things : 1 ) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses , 2 ) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses , and 3 ) we expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors . to read the full earnings press release , go to www . enron . com/corp/pressroom / releases .",2001-10-16 07:25:35

how often are those types of opportunities available , and could a power plant in alb . capture that upside by transporting power to 4 corners over pnms system ? 2 . we have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant . someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the doe/dod electric load at kirtland had a fairly high load factor . i think we have all assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell surplus power into the grid ( either at 4 corners or , after n. m. elec. restructuring , into the alb . area ) . i just found the numbers i was remembering on the conf . call -- 1998 peak load was 63.6 mw , and total annual 1998 consumption was 334.5 million kwh . by my lawyer-math , that is about a 60 % load factor for doe . if the doe load is only 60 % l. f. , and the plant only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that arise when the market clearing price at 4 corners or in albuquerque exceeds some benchmark rate ( $ .05 / kwh ? $ .10 / kwh ? higher ? ) the plant might run at a 30-40 % load factor on an annual basis . the question is can we reduce the capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit ? 3 . could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand charge contract for only 65 mw ( i. e. , doe ) but sold the rest of its output into the grid only when profit opportunities arose ? 4 . if the answer to 3 . is no , would ena backstop the debt financing by signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what the government needs ? at what price ? based on its knowledge of volatility and profit opportunities currently available at 4 corners , and future profit opportunities that will be available in albuq . is that just a dumb bet , or would ena get interested if someone else ( i. e. , doe ) split the risk and reward ? john , how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a way that we could provide it to dennis langley ? if we pull the plug on the project , i d like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our information on why the turbines we would use can t provide acceptable economics . i don t expect that we d want to disclose the swap value analysis in steve s memo , however . thanks again , and i d appreciate anyone s reaction to the above questions . df stephen thome@ect06 / 16/2000 06:12 pmto : william gang/hou/ees @eescc : john m rose/enron _development@enron _ development , bill votaw@ect , jerry d martin/enron _development@enron _ development , arnold l eisenstein/enron _development@enron _ development , steven harris@enron , drew fossum@enron , lorraine lindberg@enron subject : re : pueblo john s proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our ongoing lm6000 development . i have priced 130 mw at four corners assuming permian gas plus 50 cents for transport . this also assumes $ 4.70 per mwh for o & m and an 8000 heat rate . for an hourly 7x24 product , the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is $ 52.5 million on a 20 year deal , well below the $ 108 million estimate of constructing the facility . a ten year swap is worth only $ 42 million ( npv = -66 m ) . that implies a market mid-price of $ 34 per mwh levelized over the period . using the ena power and gas structuring model and curves , we can determine the following : 1 . new build gas turbines can not compete against the new mexico market on price . 2 . lm6000 ccgt efficiency gain does not pay for hrsg and st over a ten year period . however : 1 . transmission constraints could create market value in albuquerque that does not exist at four corners .2 . ena s power prices typically undersell the market .3 . commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in constrained markets . if enron wants to do a deal in albuquerque , we should be selling capacity and reliability . given the number of power - critical industries in the area , we could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the city . numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the kirtland base could support several lm6000 s for power reliability that is specific to their installations . i might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over ccgt units . existing generation already provides ample baseload supply , however , the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited to existing units . lm6000 s have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide real value to a utility customer . not only can the hrsg/st hinder the flexibility of the units , it can add substantial capital and operating expense with little real market benefit . we should also explore the ability to schedule load . if the doe wants to peak for a test , would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the off-peak hours ? under those circumstances , we might be able to cut them a break on power and provide reliability of supply . steve thome503-464-3708john m rose@enron _ development06/15/2000 06:53 pmto : bill gang@eescc : , stephen thome@ect subject : pueblobill , yesterday , we decided to look at two options for pueblo ; a 60 mw case and a 140 mw case . in order to match these outputs as closely as possible with available equipment , i made the following selections : case 1equipment 3 x ge lm 2500 gas turbine generators with heat recovery and 1 x 22 mw steam turbine generatoroutput at 95 deg f & 5000 ft 67 mwoutput at avg . conditions ( 60 deg f ) 73.4 mwheat rate at avg . conditions 8170 btu/kwh ( hhv ) case 2equipment 3 x ge lm 6000 gas turbine generators with heat recovery and 1 x 44 mw steam turbine generatoroutput at 95 deg f & 5000 ft 130 mwoutput at avg . conditions ( 60 deg f ) 143.7 mwheat rate at avg . conditions 7900 btu/kwh ( hhv ) there is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in albuquerque and i sized the blocks based on 95 deg f but used the annual average output at 60 deg f for estimating power sales . i have attached files that show the build-up of the estimated epc price for the plants . the required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file attached . the projections are based on : 70 % debt financing at 10 % rate.10-year project and debt life .8500 hours per year at average output ( 97 % capacity factor ) . gas at $ 4.40 / mmbtu . the results turn out pretty much as anticipated . even with the larger plant , we d have to sell the power for over 6c/kwh .",2000-06-21 09:11:00

"" over the long term i think the market will always correct itself , "" said altra s coleman . "" but in the short term , i think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another . "" enrononline director bob shults said the company is simply "" providing a service for our customers , particularly a bid and ask . but i don t think enron has the ability to move markets . we are just putting a bid and ask out there , and if people want to buy at our prices , then fine . if people want to sell at our prices , fine then sell it . i don t think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect ... we are not bigger than the marketplace . "" when asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system , shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "" big brother "" of the energy marketplace . "" the historical information is not available , "" enrononline s shults admitted .

: phillip platter 6-26-02 . pstwe are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system , ubswenergy , is ready for launch on the week of feb. 11 , which is the week following the anticipated enron/ubs closing date of friday , feb. 8 . to assist in this process , we are planning an online trading simulation for thursday , february 7 from 0900 to 1100 ( cst ) . it is planned to include all traders , originators , mid/back-office staff and it teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading . purpose of the simulation - the simulation will test our "" live "" trading environment ( restricted to internal access only ) and will : test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes ( including credit , risk , legal , operations , etc. ) provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setupdemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to ubs staff visiting next weeknature of the simulation - the simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions : credit , legal , risk , operations , and other groups : profile tests for "" external "" customers ( role-played by originators ) profile tests for internal users ( traders , back-office , etc. ) data and process checking as completed transactions flow through mid/back-office systemstraders and originators : traders will be managing their individual books and associated products . although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day , both physical and financial will be available during the simulation . each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation . originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties . credit limits , etc. will be tested during the simulation . information technology : will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation . after the simulation is over , will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk bookswill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete . next steps traders and originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system . originators will be assigned specific roles . you should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before wednesday , feb. 6 . ubswenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation . summarythis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business . we appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of ubs warburg energy and the ubswenergy trading platform . if you have any questions , comments , suggestions , or ideas regarding this simulation , please feel free to contact bob shults ( 30397 ) or myself ( 31861 ) .

chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide4@enron.com,"x-filename : tom martin 6-25-02 . pstyesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9,000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . kendear ets colleague : on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy . in this respect , enron corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved . the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business . beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas . over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work!stan",2002-01-04 14:46:24

"" every utility needs to declare which rto it plans to join by 12/1/01 ( or possibly 12/15 ; not sure of date ) . otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates , will be unable to get a merger approved , and will have its transmission rev req . scrutinized . the commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide rtos . it plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a nopr to determine this structure . the goal is to essentially re-issue the order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of rtos . although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing , expect this new effort and redefining the rto to delay ultimate implementation . although california will be allowed to heal , it is ordering an operational audit of the calfornia iso . separately the ferc indicated the plan to issue a nopr on market power and market based rates . expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates . further summary , prepared by sarah novosel in our govt . affairs dc office , is provided bel o w the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) . rtos chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational -- what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive -- once you set up the organizations , what will they do . organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to "" marry up , "" meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems . structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no. 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an "" rto week "" of advanced workshops , from october 15-19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no. 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos . wood also recognized that some "" sticks "" are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these "" sticks "" provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation . with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how "" ferc can get there . "" in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing . while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern . upcoming dates october 15-19 -- rto workshops end of october -- further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos december 15 , 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revokedproposed rule for standards of conductwithin the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( "" nopr "" ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards . the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to . there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal . provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap ) chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability . after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) . commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers . realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process . sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions . sarah",2001-09-27 08:12:45

sally.beck@enron.com,brent.price@enron.com,"fyi ---------------------- forwarded by sally beck/hou/ect on 07/20/2000 07:17 pm --------------------------- peggy hedstrom 07/20/2000 10:49 am to : sally beck/hou/ect @ectcc : subject : re : financial confirm np6050 .1 thanks for your prompt response . i really hope that you can convince mark taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to calgary is the right thing to do . as you recall , we have been down the road of improving the service to calgary previously . this seems to work in the short term , but as soon as there is turnover in the group , which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly , the service level starts to drop . i would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to calgary when you meet with mark . first , when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to calgary , mark taylor s concern was our legal staff . at that time , we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area . we now have three very competent attorneys . greg johnston has spent time in houston and has recently attended an isda training course . second , there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by houston and with the process itself . at the time of the project doorstep audit , we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them . as you saw from my memo , confirmations are periodically sent out without our review . also , we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves , including the contract date referred to in the confirmation . the first two issues cause me a lot of concern . some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong , which is a big problem . we had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out , which is even a bigger problem . third , there is no real additional control in the process by having houston generate the confirmations . if you think about what the process is , the transactions are done in calgary , we fax the deal sheets to houston , the confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by legal , we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if done by enron canada corp. , or send an e-mail if the enron entity is enron north america . houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty . if the counterparty is a trading company , houston follows up on the status of execution . for all other entities , the calgary office is now doing the follow-up . all these transactions are currently settled out of the calgary office . if the transactions were done in calgary , we would be using the same pre-approved templates that houston is using . it is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in houston , or , conversely , why there is any additional risk in having calgary prepare our own financial confirmations . if there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having calgary prepare the financial confirmations , why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?fourth , there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in houston while the review process is done in calgary . currently , houston has staff handling the calgary transactions . because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here , i have similar staff who print the confirmations , route them for review , update tagg , notify houston when the review is complete , and then follow-up with either houston or the counterparty on issues or execution . we are currently following up on all non-trading company financial confirmations . so , we are both printing and reviewing the transactions , following up with the counterparties , and filing these documents . as i stated before , calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff . fifth , there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in houston . because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth , the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the transaction being done . we feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here . this reduces risk for enron . finally , because we are a small office , i need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they don t feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base . given the skill sets of the documentation group , it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk , logistics , or accounting , so it is important that i am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group . because we review the confirmations , the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists . however , i know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function , and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations . as a final note , i report to you . i am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly . it would mean a lot to me , as well as the documentation staff , to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to calgary . mark taylor has never met me or my staff , yet i get the impression that he doesn t think we are capable of handling this function . i hope that you will be able to set him straight on this . he just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here . if you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo , please let me know . as you can see , the calgary office feels very strongly about this issue , including rob milthorp and peter keohane . please let me know how your meeting with mark goes . thanks , peggy enron north america corp . from : sally beck 07/19/2000 04:57 pm to : peggy hedstrom/cal/ect @ectcc : subject : re : financial confirm np6050 .1 i got your message and i have asked brent to get with me when he is back in the office on friday ( he has been in new york re : mg since monday night ) . together we will do two things : ( 1 ) devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to calgary starting immediately , and ( 2 ) work with mark taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to calgary and to eliminate his concerns . we will keep you posted on both items . -- sally peggy hedstrom 07/19/2000 12:02 pm to : sally beck/hou/ect @ectcc : subject : re : financial confirm np6050 .1 just so that you are aware , we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from houston . on more than one occasion , confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by calgary . attached is the most recent one . we have been assured over and over that this will not happen again , however , it continues to happen . luckily , this confirmation went out without any errors in it . i know that you are very busy , but is there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the financial confirmations to calgary . ---------------------- forwarded by peggy hedstrom/cal/ect on 07/18/2000 02:10 pm --------------------------- from : larry joe hunter

sap plans two years ago enron north america made a decision to use unify ar for cash application rather than sap ar . we decided at the time that sap ar would be kept in sync with unify ar by the unify/sap interface . we believe that the business logic for that decision has changed , and are now recommending that unify ar be permanently turned off and all ar functions be performed in sap . i have briefly summarized the change in business situation below . two years ago todaynetting allowed by legal and credit only if netting contract was already in place . netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible , regardless of existence of signed agreement . netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time . canada nets across counterparties . netting performed in physical only , financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process . ena considering netting physical and financial together . all account coordinators were to apply their own cash . cash applied centrally in power , financial and canada individual coordinators apply cash only in physical gas . cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team . although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level , this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements . the company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team . the account inquiry functionality in unify was thought to be a key on-line tool . old habits die hard ... most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data , rather than using the on-line functionality . overapplication of cash was not to be allowed . overpayments would be classified as "" on account "" , with issues tracked in a case management system . case management system does not exist . allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account . the counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterparty/legal entity combination on the enron invoice . given the number of legal entities enron has , along with the number of entities our counterparties have , this seems like a hopeless battle . allowing cross-application of cash seems easier . corp required that intercompany settlements had to be "" settled "" with cash movement . corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be "" settled "" with cash movement . converting to sap ar simplifies the unify/sap interface in the following ways : bank deposits into sap do not have to be split off into unifycash entries in unify do not have to be interfaced back to sapunify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to sappayables information does not have to be interfaced from sap to unifygiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in unify . controls built into unify are already obsolete . unify does not maintain all products in one database , making efforts to net across products in the future ( physical with financial , for instance ) impossible . our understanding of the netting process in sap indicates that there are no controls ( which sounds good at this point ) and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within sap . however , we emphasize that netting would be done in sap , not at the time of finaling a payment in unify . to repeat , we are recommending that unify ar be turned off and we convert to sap ar . we will schedule a meeting the week of february 22 to discuss . please call me at x33179 with any questions or comments . we will make this decision by february 28 because the sap timeline does not allow any additional time for consideration . stephen",2000-04-19 06:03:00

157 yards as longhorns gore tigers , 35-16junior qb chris simms and true freshman rb cedric benson had career-best daysand the ut defense held missouri to just one first down in the first andthird quarters saturday in columbia to lead texas to a 35-16 victory . on a day when upsets reigned across the country , particularly in the top 10 , and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost , the longhorns took careof business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the big 12 . with oklahoma s 20-10 loss at nebraska , the sooners , longhorns and aggies areall tied atop the standings in the big 12 south . but the longhorns have to win out and oklahoma has to lose another conferencegame for the longhorns to make it to the big 12 championship game . saturday s victory at missouri was a fairly easy conquest , thanks to thestout ut defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowedsimms to complete 24 of 30 passes ( 80 % ) for 229 yards and four touchdowns andbenson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries , an average of 5.1 yards a pop . but some strange things happened to thwart the longhorns in the early going . on their first drive , for example , they held the ball almost 10 minutes , rolling 78 yards in 19 plays , but they got zero points because they stalledat the tiger 2 and dusty mangum missed the chip-shot field goal . they also drove into missouri territory on their second possession , but againstalled . missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first . that seemed to wake up the longhorn offense and it took control and wore outthe missouri defenders . here , briefly , is how the game wentfirst quartertexas won the toss and deferred . missouri took the ball and marcus james ranthe ut kick back to the 38 . the longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-outand the ut offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year , going 78yards in a laborious 10-minute , 19-play drive to the tiger 2 , but dustymangum missed the chip-shot field goal . missouri went three-and-out again . the horns drove to midfield again , but stalled as the quarter ended . texashad a huge lead in statistics , with 7 first downs to 0 for missouri , a 99-24edge in total offense , and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession , butthe game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts . second quarterthe tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarterand drove 76 yards , primarily on the passing of qb kirk farmer , to take a 7-0lead with 11:12 left . victor ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and thelonghorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up . simms connected with wr b. j. johnson on the 5-yard td toss , but the big play was a 27-yarder from simmsto te bo scaife on third-and-2 at the missouri 32 . mangum s kick tied it,7-7 , with 5:44 left . after the ut defense forced another quick 3-and-out andgot a short punt , simms found scaife again on the first play for a 28-yardgain to the mu 13 . a wr reverse by johnson got 5 yards and benson got 5 moreand a first down at the 3 before simms faked to benson and hit te brockedwards for the final 3 yards and the td . mangum s kick gave texas a 14-7lead with 1:50 left . the tigers stormed down the field in the final twominutes , primarily on the running of 5-10 , 225-pound zack abron , who gained37 yards in three carries . his 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave thetigers a first-and-goal , but his next try gained only a yard and farmer threwtwo incompletions before brad hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cutthe ut lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left . the tigers outgained the longhornsin the quarter , 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs . third quartertexas got the ball and again made a long , time-consuming drive , but this timeit counted because simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and mangumconverted for a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left . the longhorns overcame athird-and-11 early in the drive when simms scrambled and found brett robinfor 24 yards . vasher intercepted farmer four plays later to give the hornsgreat field position at the mu 48 . the longhorns couldn t move , but the pickkept missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter andallowed texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that wasdominated by defense after texas impressive opening drive . the tigers madeonly one first down in the quarter and texas , after getting five first downson that opening td drive , managed only one more in the entire quarter . fourth quarterthe tigers finally figured out their best offense was to hand the ball toabron and he bulled for 16 , 19 , 3 and then 7 more for a td . missouri s passfor a 2-point conversion failed and left ut on top , 28-16 , with 7:41 left . not to be outdone , benson shredded the missouri defense for 11 , 20 and then 4before simms scrambled left and found robin , who scampered the final 25yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play . mangum s kick gave texas a 35-16lead with 4:27 left . texas and the bcsthe next bowl championship series ( bcs ) standings will be a lot differentfrom the first ones that were announced last week and texas will be a lothigher than it was in the last one . in the first standings , which were announced last monday , texas was rankedno . 6 behind five teams with perfect records . the bcs standings are like golfin that the lowest score is the best score . oklahoma came in at no. 1 in the first standings at 3.06 , followed bynebraska at 6.40 , ucla at 8.34 , miami at 12.01 , virginia tech at 13.88 , texasat 15.35 and michigan at 15.91 , to round out the top seven . but a rash of upsets claimed ou , ucla and virginia tech . since ou lost to nebraska , the sooners won t tumble far , but texas shouldpass ucla and vt. of course , michigan is so close to texas that thewolverines might pass the horns if they keep winning . under the bcs formula , the top four teams in the final standings areguaranteed berths in one of the four bcs bowls , which are the rose , orange , fiesta and sugar . the rose bowl will get the national title game this year . right now , thatlooks like a nebraska-miami battle , but both teams have some big games leftbefore making that date . texas could make it to the rose bowl , but it would require some big upsets , like texas a & m or texas tech upsetting oklahoma , and then texas beatingnebraska in the big 12 title game . but the longhorns will make it to one of the big bcs bowls if they keepwinning . key games for bcs watchersif you want to keep tabs on the longhorns chances to wind up in good shapein one of the big four bcs bowls , the key is that they have to win theirfinal three regular season games . assuming that happens , here are some key games to watch for the rest of theseason : this saturday s key games are michigan at michigan state , tennessee at notredame and ucla at washington state . the big ones the following saturday , nov. 10 , are texas a & m at oklahoma anducla at oregon . on nov. 17 , texas tech hosts oklahoma , syracuse is at miami , michigan is atwisconsin and virginia tech is at virginia . on thanksgiving weekend , michigan hosts ohio state , nebraska goes to coloradoand oklahoma state plays at oklahoma . the big games on dec. 1 are miami at virginia tech , tennessee at florida andoregon state at at oregon . if oklahoma loses to a & m , tech or osu and the longhorns win out , texas wouldqualify for the big 12 championship game on dec. 8 . the final bcs rankings will be released on december 9 , the day after the big12 and southeastern conference have their championship games . texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the bcs rankings to be releasedtoday and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in wherethe horns wind up . jackson , mcclintock to redshirtit looks like senior lb lee jackson and junior de o. j. mcclintock willredshirt . both have been out with injuries all season and head coach mack brown saidlast week there are no plans to play them . he said jackson is still having troubles with his

but they need to keep working to get better , headcoach mack brown said sunday . after studying films of the 35-16 victory over missouri , brown said he andhis assistants were generally pleased with the team s play . but he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week . "" we weren tpleased with out tackling , "" brown said . "" we weren t pleased one back gainedover 100 yards on us . we ve got to get back to work on that . "" he also said the defense did a good job in permitting missouri to get intothe red zone only three times all day "" but they scored all three times . that s not what we want .

"" he also said his head turned texas way at the end because coach rick barneshas established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winningbig-time recruits "" after looking at it closely , "" he said , "" i think texas basketball is reallyon the upswing . they ve signed two mcdonald s all americans ( freshman pointguard t. j. ford of fort bend willowridge and sophomore forward brianboddicker of duncanville ) in the last two years . "" they could make it three in three years because buckman s stock soared thissummer when he starred in several top aau tournaments . brick oettinger , publisher of prep stars recruiter s handbook , was asked whowas the biggest surprise of the summer . oettinger said , "" in terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody s top 100to everybody s top 25 - it would be brad buckman . big forward , veryaggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . . anybody in the class . i ve got him no. 21 now and he wasn t in my top 100 . dave telep , another national recruiting analyst , agreed buckman is a nationaltop 25 recruit . "" the reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names , thereprobably aren t 25 better players in the class , "" telep said . "" he is athletic , can handle it some , he blocks shots , he shoots to medium-range and he scoresin the post . "" clifton mcneely , the westlake coach , also says his star s work ethic is offthe chart . "" he s a very gifted player with a lot of talent , "" mcneely said , "" but the bestthing about him is his strong heart and work ethic . i don t think you couldfind anyone who works harder than he does . "" mcneely also said he thinksbuckman "" is the best player in texas . "" there are some guards in the dallas area who ranked higher nationally , including bracy wright of the colony , who chose indiana , daniel horton ofcedar hill , who picked michigan , and bryan hopkins of dallas lincoln , whocommitted to smu . the longhorns recruited all three of those star guards , but lost out on themat the end . buckman averaged 20 points , 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for westlake as ajunior . and he s the kind of blue-collar inside player barnes loves . mcneely said buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-pointrange . asked to compare him to luke axtell and chris mihm , two other westlakeplayers he coached who played at ut , he said , "" he has the physical presenceof mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school , and he has the rangeof luke . "" he is the first recruit to commit to texas for the early signing period nextmonth . barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players , most of themin other states , and hope to sign a sharp shooting guard and a wing . buckman s father , brent , played on two national championship golf teams atut . basketball team has new lookthe longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with theaddition of heralded point guard t. j. ford , who led fort bend willowridge toback-to-back class 5a state titles . when the season starts next month , ford will be called upon to speed up thehorns offense and also create more opportunities for the team s insideplayers with his lightning-quick passes . coach rick barnes is hoping ford s creativity in the half-court offense willimprove the scoring punch of center james thomas , who averaged 7 points and6 .5 rebounds a game last year . ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for seniorforward chris owens , sophomore wings brandon mouton and royal ivey , and 6-9forward brian boddicker . barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year . fredie williams , ivey and shooting guard darren kelly took turns at the point . barnes and the horns coped with it admirably , going 25-9 overall and 12-4 inthe tough big 12 , but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88more turnovers than assists . ford should help raise the former and lower thelatter . they also lost in the first round of the ncaa tournament to temple , andbarnes hopes ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into theplayoffs this season . replacing departed wing maurice evans and kelley , who combined for 30.8 ofut s 70.5 per-game scoring average , creates scoring opportunities for othershooters . now barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity . he expects mouton and ivey to step up there . sydmill harris , a 6-6 freshmanfrom the netherlands , has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts . owens was a star in the world university games during the summer and isexpected to be one of the top players in the big 12 , and a more dependablescoring threat .

"" it clicked . i didn t do what i wanted to do and i knew i had theability . now i have the mental concentration .
