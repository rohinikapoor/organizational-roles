issues 1 legal and privacy statement we believe that the legal and privacy statement should be available on the first entry page for the enron website and on each of the main trading pages in the same form and style as the other navigational links the legal and privacy statement contains important legal protections for enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in a prominent fashion  the more prominent the display the easier it will be for enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this statement and therefore that it is binding on them 2 bid box when a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the website a bid box appears  it is important that this box contains wording that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an offer that enron is free to accept or reject  on that basis we recommend that the main wording in the bid box be i want to buy quantity or i want to sell quantity 3 availability of pa and eta there is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by courts in england  to improve enron s argument that the eta has been sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty we advise that the eta be available for viewing and printing at all times through a hotlink in the trading section of the website this will assist our argument that the eta is incorporated by reference when a counterparty signs the pa  if for some reason for example the eta is not available at the time of signing the pa the direct incorporation of the eta argument fails the hotlink to the eta may help to establish a course of dealing argument  that is an argument that over time the counterparty has been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has therefore affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions 4 registration forms we look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form for new customers  we also look forward to reviewing the online registration form for view only users of the website  prior to our review of the view only registration form can you please confirm whether or not enron will be vetting view only applications  if view only users are issued passwords automatically without a confirmation of identity or other verification or clearance by enron then we should discuss the possible risks and legal issues that may arise 5 master agreements we understand that enron is internally discussing the relationship between master agreement nbp terms and nbp side letters  the conclusion of these discussion may require an amendment to the eta in particular clause 3a 6 changes to the gtcs and eta it is clear from an english law perspective and the bulk of overseas jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the gtcs or eta will require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version of the agreement  three issues have arisen in implementing this process a marking up changes  from a legal as well as a public relations perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for indicating what changes have been made  this process could take the form of a list of changes or double underline or other markup procedure changes should be indicated against the previous version all versions should be dated  similarly the ticker tape screen should indicate that there is a new version until that new version is accepted that said this position is advisable only if enron can be certain that all changes to amended agreements are identified  if amended agreements are presented for execution that are improperly markedup or do not markup certain changes then enron would have a lesser chance of enforcing these unmarked changes than if no markingup was shown therefore this process is advisable only if enron can ensure that all changes are identified b notice of changes we have previously discussed with you what procedure should be adopted by enron to notify counterparties of the change in the eta or gtcs  to improve any argument that a counterparty has freely consented to an amended agreement we would advise that enron adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements in advance of them taking effect  this notice should not be a contractual obligation rather an internal enron procedure  that said we understand from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an immediate change to an agreement with the result that trading is suspended under the old agreement  if those circumstances are likely to be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made then the notice process may not necessarily be appropriate  if notice is not given then enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement i that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended and if markups are provided that the changes were indicated and ii that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry these elements are not conclusive but would give enron an argument that the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement c overseas counsel advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the eta and gtcs did not specify that enron would not be giving the counterparty a period of notice of changes to the agreements during which the counterparty could continue to trade  therefore if it is ultimately decided that no notice period will be used then we may need to seek further advice from overseas counsel 7 eta termination under your recent instructions we have amended the eta so that it can only be terminated for convenience by enron  that is there is no express termination for convenience right for a counterparty  we have previously noted that this means that an eta may continue to be in force with a counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with enron  advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the eta and gtcs was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice we will seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue 8 website text review we look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractual obligations formed using the website 9 data protection since our meetings and conference call we have discussed further our recent advice to you on data protection  we are currently seeking the further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice to you shortly 10 german digital signatures further advice is being sought from german counsel  we will provide you with a response on this issue shortly we hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number of issues  please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any aspect of this matter regards timothy hughesandrew wilkinsonthe information in this email and in any attachments is confidential and

niesler stefan aronowitz alan keogh alisonsubject re enron japan  eol  yen denominated wti swapjane happy to  work through this with you in essence there are 2 steps  firstly there is approving the gtcs and the product description as justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the  jurisdiction or more particularly the  enron counterparty if the decision is to use us law the counterparty would be ena in this case an ews lawyer in houston would give the signoff to both the gtcs and the product description the two are handled together conversely if  japanese law is chosen then the enron counterparty that would do an otc trade for that product in japan would be the counterparty that i assume would be ej which choice of law and counterparty to use  it has been the practice to follow the currency for example in understand  ena offers  japanese and australian weather in usd there is also a final legal signoff given by mark taylor this is generally a formality as mark would be primarily concerned that  relevant lawyer has given their oksecondly each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product this is done by the lawyer responsible for the product ie the one that approved the gtcs as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporatedresident hence i would assume you would be approving japanese counterparties irrespective of whether ej or ena is the counterpartygive me call                          original messagefrom  timothy justin  sent wednesday 31 october 2001 516 pmto mcbride janecc niesler stefan minns david aronowitz alan keogh

 yen denominated wti swaphi alan and susanas you may know enron japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto eol in an effort to try and pry the japanese market open a little bit faster  although this is an enron japan initiative the enron cp would be ena so the governing law should probably not be japanese but this is unclear  there is a thought that japanese cps may prefer japanese law but it is also arguable whether they would know or care  in any case susan any tax issues in having ena doing yen denominated trades over eol under japanese lawanyway the main reason for the email is that i have some very boring questions  alan i am not sure and to be honest have never really been able to figure out who makes global eol legal decisions whether they come out of london or houston because seems to be some overlap  but since the cp would be ena houston legal will have to be involved so perhaps mark taylor but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person1 procedure wise  who should draft the gtcs for this new product2 if they are done under a us law  who gives legal sign off 3 if they are done under japanese law  can i sign off very happy to do so but not having any eol experience i would need to work closely with someone from eol legal who could confirm that other than any issues of japanese law they are consistent with what we want from the eol gtcs generally4 who signs off on product descriptions  what is the formal process  i assume it includes the commercial person  in this case stefan niesler does it also require someone from legal do i do this as the ej lawyer  should l also get the ena lawyer to approve since the cp is enasorry if these questions seem trivial but i don t know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing whatthanks very muchkind regardsjane mcbridesenior legal counselenron japan corptel 813 5219 4553    original messagefrom

stefan  sent friday october 26 2001 332 amto musch susansubject yen nominated wti swapsusani hope i didn t confuse you too much yesterday night here is a quick run down on how we think the japanese yen nominated wti swap could workthe mechanics remain the same the us wti swap quotes are converted in yenkl and posted on eol incoming transaction are hedged out against the us wti swap and the fx exposure is hedge out manually the enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ena same as for the us wti swap the fx hedging will be done by people here in tokyo who act as agents for ena that s nothing new they already do that fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ena and why are we involved in the product development first of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution ena is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books no ej books as touched in this transactions the rational for ej is purely marketing relate we underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the japanese market it is supporting our overall market penetration effort the issue that it is not enron japan entering into the contract is secondary as the japanese market is looking at enron as a group possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don t see as material the customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with nonjapanese counterparties in addition the credit rating of ena is far better the ej s from a japanese point of view i hope this helps to clarify some things please feel free to call me if i left anything out or if you need some additional informationthank youregardsstn

proceeding changeschristi   i don t think it changes the requirement to file by october 1 either and we are proceeding under the same schedule  several rehearing requests were submitted including one for enaees  however note the following which i sent out in an earlier message to the enaees western commercial and government affairs folks i noted you deleted your message without reading it  i consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this omb ruling a good sign 20as detailed in the attached ferc notice the office of management and budget omb has approved ferc s information collection request for reporting of natural gas sales to the california market through the sixmonth emergency period that will expire on 13102  emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the omb regulations  however it gave ferc several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extendedomb has advised ferc that if it decides to request renewal of the information collection request after that date it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit discussion  as you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of the ferc order ena and ees submitted comments to omb regarding our problems with ferc s estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information  we pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep our records in that manner  we manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale  we stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the taskthe issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that omb requires ferc to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 13102  ferc indicated in its july order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 93002 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan  omb questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way  omb expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial  omb also required ferc to evaluate its burden estimates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of the names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contactedferc has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request  while we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that the omb action will affect their final decision  at the least it sends a signal  file ic0172100a

with phil marsten on the phone to get more information as to the purpose of caem and its supportersas you know enron s attempt at implementation of these technologies a couple of years ago randy maffett s group hit upon many obstacles mostly resistance or reluctance by utilities to allow or sponsor such projects20there is some value to the caem approach  that is to help the vendorsproprietors of the technology by educating regulators and policy makers to the value of these solutions20presently phil is talking with some transmission companies  but none of the major problem area names were mentioned20phase i  evaluating technology get a common understanding of these systems technically then  analysis into the regulatory impacts includes hiring experts to evaluate the technologies cost commercialability etc20a certs doe effort was technology focused not focused on the policy side i asked phil if he was aware of any similar efforts at epri eei or ieee to see if there is any duplication  he did not know  i will ask someone to research whether these organizations are trying the same  if they are then there is no need to reinvent the wheel20phil mentioned that rob bradley has information on funding this effort that may allow enron participation without financial contribution20i left it open to invite phil to meet with enron folks if we are interested in joining 2020in my opinion rtos will ultimately have to be on board from both a planning and operational perspective to implement these solutions  policy makers are certainly important  but rto endorsement can be just as effective of a catalyst for implementing these solutions  regulators tend to defer to the technical experts so would caem be effective or needed on the rto front  also in steve walton s opinion much more atc and ttc is left off the table than what these technologies may be able to offer so you can get more bang for the buck by pushing for better nerc rules curbing regional council authority getting more ferc action etc  caem technologies could become a crutch for a badboy utility to not doing what is right in the first place  we would not want a regulator to lose sight of the real problems at hand today202020original messagefrom mcvicker maureen20sent monday august 20 2001 351 pmto yeung charlessubject fw invitation to participate in caem s grid enhancement evaluation

wednesday july 25 2001 515 pmsubject invitation to participate in caem s grid enhancement evaluation projectsteve keanenron corp20delivered via email to skeanenroncom mailtoskeanenroncom2020dear steve2020i m wearing a somewhat different hat today that of adjunct scholar to ken malloy s center for the advancement of energy markets caem  in that capacity i am directing the center s recently announced grid enhancement evaluation project  the full proposal is attached below as a pdf file i ve also included for your records an updated resume on my qualifications to direct the project     2020you know better than any in the industry how the restructuring of the nation s electricity markets and regulatory infrastructure is continuing in the face of greater uncertainty than at any time since the oil price shocks of the 1970s  and as one of the major participants in the business as well as the policy debate over the future shape of the generation and transmission industries enron is also well aware that a key component of any regulatory outcome will be efforts to enhance the performance of the transmission grid   the purpose of caem s grid enhancement evaluation project is therefore to provide an independent assessment of the new grid debottlenecking and flow control and management technologies to provide the public  and policymakers  with a better understanding of how these new systems operate what they will cost how they may be deployed and in particular how these potentially disruptive technologies will synch with the currently evolving regulatory framework  this effort should be especially timely in light of the concern over the extent to which the current changes in the regulatory framework are really being created to address problems resulting from the crazyquilt legacy transmission system and may tend to institutionalize some aspects of those legacy systems      2020the center is proposing to bring together a blueribbon panel to evaluate opportunities for enhancing the nation s electric transmission grid through the use of various new technologies including in particular solidstate power electronicsbased solutions facts technologies high voltage direct current hvdc  interconnectors across seams in the regional grids and superconductingbased technologies  the grid enhancement evaluation project is the only effort of its kind to bring together a diverse group of senior executives to undertake the following  1 agree upon the appropriate methodology 2 using the methodology authorize a panel of experts to independently evaluate the technologies on their state of development and current commercial viability 3 make policy recommendations on what changes may be required to integrate these new technologies into the existing regulatory framework and eliminate identified barriers to commercial deployment and 4 conduct an educational campaign to raise public awareness and acceptance of these technologies 20the project will begin in the fall of 2001 and a final report will be issued january 2002  the project is expected to have a significant impact on decisions made by regulators financial analysts utility executives the media and potential customers   consistent with the center s usual practice the project will include public are as well as private sector participants and will culminate in a public report20we would welcome your participation steve or the appropriate enron designate to this effort  perhaps i can call you in a few days after you ve had a chance to review the attached project description which is about 12 pages  as i m currently out of the country the best way to reach me is via email at pmarstonmarstonlawcom mailtopmarstonmarstonlawcom and i will call you promptly at your convenience 2020on

or what a don t be embarrassed most of us were never taught thesethings in school asking about them is the only way to learnprices of stocks are always in dollars per share they re notalways in whole numbers though the world of stock prices isfull of fractions all the way down to 64ths and occasionallyeven smaller ones so if the film editing firm splice girls incticker splic is listed at 28 that means it last traded at28 per share similarly 15 1732 means 1553125 or 1553 pershareanother way to think of it is to consider how much total marketvalue the company has gained or lost with each price move findhow many shares outstanding the company has do this via onlinestock research tools your newspaper or the firm s financialstatements multiply that number by the share price if splichas 200 million shares outstanding and drops by 2 per sharethe company has lost 400 million in market value q what are buyside and sellside analysts a buyside analysts work inhouse for institutions such

another way isto calculate its inverse which is its earnings yieldconsider the example of fryyndar and ulf scandinavianpharmaceuticals ticker fandu whose motto is varsgod ochsvlj that s swedish for here swallow this pill tocalculate its pe ratio you simply divide the current stockprice by the annual earnings per share eps if its currentannual eps is 3 and the stock is trading for 111 per sharethe pe is 111 divided by 3 or 37 while 37 might seem steepit s not meaningful until you compare it with the pe ratios ofindustry peers and consider its growth prospects a high pemeans the market is assuming rapid growth is that assumptionreasonableto calculate fryyndar and ulf s earnings yield just reverse thepe ratio dividing the annual eps by the current stock price3 divided by 111 equals 0027 or 27 percent compared toriskfree treasury bond rates of roughly 5 percent this doesn tappear to be a bargain but remember whereas bond rates arefixed earnings typically grow imagine that fandu is expectedto increase earnings by 10 percent per year if so in 10 yearseps should grow to 778 assuming we bought shares when theywere at 111 the earnings yield for us has now become 7percent considerably better 778 divided by 111 is 007it can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growingearnings yield to pass the current 30year bond rate which isnow about 55 percent fandu passes it in six yearsif your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is 15percent it will take fandu 18 years to reach that target  ifearnings actually grow at the estimated pace that is perhapsyou can find another investment that will get you there morequickly with riskier companies you might look for them to passyour target rate sooner rather than laterthe earnings yield is just one of many

per metric on a fob richards bay equivalent and claiming it was heading swiftly to 35 while there had been some nervousshort covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had  fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined andin general have refused to commit to these numbers the lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and ofcourse mkt psychology with it while producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of 31 fob richards bay and wud trade down to 3050 several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days thatnegotiations between kepco and south african producers for price fixing 2001 tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will bean additional 3 million mt which the south africans have to find a home for  destination europe most likely on the flip side kepco willbe looking towards indonesia and china to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that formosa plastic will be lookingfor some 3 million tonnes of additional material from china cud serve to tighten the pacific mkt over the next months for first half 2001there is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over last three weeks with business being booked out of the us indonesia and australia at numbers close to what was achievable fromsa into europe this can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this mktplace and indeed german utilities who have been held to ransom by similar minded producers in poland are now exploring every end to do business with other suppliers  namely ourselves in order to avoid being captive to one supplier weglekoks incidentally are

eol trades for november stand at 195 million mt out of a running total of 367 million from it s inception as the figures suggest there is increasing activityliquidity in the market with the arrival of

offering our products in euros aswell the good old green backmuch to the confusion of one or two of our clients at current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the 5 millmark by the end of the yeargameplan we are currently long to the tune of 15 mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to 2004strip these out and effectively we are running a short ara position of some 15 mill mt  weighted pretty evenly across q2 q3 and q42001 backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both richards bay and drummond we are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term cal 01 business while running a europeanshort pos n which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both the frt mkts and in the atlantic coal mkt shud the the european mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the money options which we wud utilise to

however one major impediment  while locating the plant nearat the source ie minemouth will ease transport costs for coal there aren t many major coal mines located in the prime market zones for power  the transmission wires grid was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk tradingtransport the way gas does and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous infinitely more so than building new plants  for example the average lead time to permit not built just permit a highvoltage power line is 57 years  as a result a medium sized line 345kv 200 miles can cost upwards of 12 billion  that was the most frustrating part of the 18 months i chased this stuff  while the basic solutions appear to be so logical the business the utilities regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking that breaking in was basically impossible  unless we re willing to put a billion  at risk for 57 years on a merchant basis  not  hell you can t even get 100 million for your refinery deal  solving the power supply shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas  but until the ferc and state pucs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more fungible and integrated transmission system the utilities will continue to operate in their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting their turfs  even though some have given the appearance of forming rto siso s regional transmission organizations or independent system operators this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover each other s asses  the assets are still owned by the utilities themselves and the rtoiso has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring capital investment other than routine maintenance etc  that s the whole genesis of what i was trying to preach to ferc various utilities who appeared to be more forward thinking about dereg etc  basically you d be trading one evil transport for fuel for another transport for electrons and i m afraid the latter is infinitely more complex engineering wise and costlysee ya  friday      from  doug leach

mcclellanhouectectcc jeffrey a shankmanhouectect marc de la rochehouectect subject coal plantsgeorgei m sure i am way over simplifying this but in light of current natural gas prices and the past success ena had building six natural gas power plants wouldn t the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the us i m sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting process is far more severe than the natural gas process but it would seem enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants wouldn t it make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual coal supply whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and then supply power by wire to surrounding states states rich in coal reserves are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and therefore may speed the permitting process along building the power transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive but has this approach been analyzed by the coal group regardsdoug

did this our problem would be solved    walt  the message below was sent to an old af buddy who forwarded it on to me withthe invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit i send it on to youwith the same invitation it offers some pretty good ideas  my name is john burnett i am a dc10 captain for fedex i am also a policeofficer for the memphis police department my purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actionsa pilot might consider when faced with a modernday hijacker these thoughtsare outsidethebox when it comes to the way we ve all been trainedneither the faa or our companies will suggest these techniques or implementthem as a part of our normal training cycles they couldn t for fear oflawsuits i am distributing this via email to buddies i ve flown with i m askingthem to send it to their circle of friends within the industry and for youto send it to yours i know most of us have email and i hope this reachesthe next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard we have all had training in what to do in case of a hijacking try to keepthe hijacker calm make him think you re doing what he wants take him whereever he wants to go etc etc etc save your passengers your crew andyour aircraft in an emergency you will revert to that training when our unfortunatepeers were faced with the screams of the flight attendants and hijacker sdemands to open the cockpit door their training probably made them open thedoor when the fanatics made demands their training told them to comply asbest they could i can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left thecockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane what they thought as theydescended over new york i hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their deadbodies out of the cockpit but i bet they did as they were trained to do as you look back over recent hijackings fedex and egypt air and now theseptember 11th hijackings you see a perpetrator who for one reason oranother wants to take over the airplane and kill himself each of thesehijackers except for the fedex incident were successful they took overthe airplane and killed everyone onboard if you re following the news programs today you hear a lot about how wecould let these hijackers learn to fly you would think if knowing how tofly would guarantee a successful hijacking auburn calloway the fedexhijacker would have been a hijacker success story calloway had been a navy pilot a martial arts student a fellow fedex crewmember and he took all the weapons he needed hammers knives and a speargun he didn t have to overcome any flight attendants or demand they openthe cockpit door he just went back to his bag took out his hammer cameback into the cockpit and started crushing skulls the crew members on that flight didn t worry about flight attendants theydidn t worry about passengers all three pilots left the cockpit and foughta handtohand lifeordeath battle to survive today s hijacker you cannot worry about your passengers youcannot worry about your flight attendants you must develop a mindset thateveryone onboard  including yourself  is already dead because if thehijacker is successful in taking over your airplane not only you yourcrew your passengers and your aircraft are lost but thousands on theground are at risk one of the reasons the fedex crew survived is the extraordinary actions ofthe copilot although he had brain injury the copilot took the dc10 andimmediately executed a halfroll this maneuver took the hijacker off hisfeet as the captain and so were struggling with him during a point in the maneuver the hijacker captain and so were thrownback behind the cockpit door when he righted the airplane the fo thenleft his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane it wasonly after the captain determined the hijacker was subdued he returned tothe cockpit and flew the airplane to landing very few of us have had to confront true evil fewer still have seriouslyconsidered taking the life of another human being i believe this is thereason the fedex crew did not kill their attacker the crew s heroism thatday is beyond belief and any action that leads to a safe landing andrecovery cannot be argued with but when the captain left the fo and so thinking the situation was undercontrol he was mistaken the fo and so had sustained seriouslifethreatening injuries the hijacker had not as the captain flew theaircraft the hijacker who had surrendered began the fight anew as the airplane landed the hijacker was just moments away from overcomingthe two crew members i mention this for your consideration i would suggest that you make aconscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from youtoday we are at war the hijacker who comes through your cockpit door isgoing to kill you and everyone onboard so how do you do that what weaponsare available to us as pilots the intercom command that all men come forward and fight with thehijackers you have many ablebodied men onboard they are sitting in shocknot knowing what to do command that they come forward and help you killyour attackers and they will come the airplane itself get the hijackers off their feet go into an immediatedive to float them to the ceiling then execute a 6g positive maneuver andhope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor galleyshelf etc pull the fire handles shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves offif you lose the battle at least the airplane won t be used as a guidedmissile on a kamikaze mission with luck maybe these guys didn t learn howto do an inflight restart then leave the cockpit  all of you and killyour attackers  don t believe it when they surrender  don t be nice tothem  kill them flare gun if your airplane has one the captain might consider making sureit s loaded and secured next to his bag i can think of nothing moresatisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into afanatic s gut the crashaxe i would suggest you have your copilot take it from it sholder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available makesan excellent skull crusher your flashlight the faa use to require a 2 cell a 3 cell maglight makesan excellent weapon if your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floorwrithing in pain crush their skulls your stolen hotel bic pen drive it into an attacker s eye ear throat orinto the area just under the jaw bone that s a particular interesting placeto drive it because when he opens his mouth to scream you can read hyattsticking there your hand and fingers drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel yourfingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets scoop the eyeballs out itwill confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoesas they dangle there on the ocular nerves your teeth remember hannibal lecter eat a nose a cheek or a finger andkeep eating attack with all viciousness a piranha is a small fish butit s greatly feared a hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it mightmake him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with it will atleast impress his buddies now here s my wishlist of things the faa could do to help especially inthis time of war arm the captain the battle is not going to require any long shots a small revolver would bea good choice it would hold off the attackers long enough for you todisable your aircraft if the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb i dshoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and thehijacker and his package would be sucked out and hey i if i got sucked outwith him i d try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laughat him all the way to the ground invite the police to man the jump seatpolice are always looking for something free donut shops use to be afavorite target for robbers  until they started giving donuts to thepolice robbers don t rob donut shops anymore i would suggest each policedepartment send the faa a list of the best shots on the department and thoseguys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane fill every vacant seat with armed police  give them a donut  and tell themto shoot anyone who gives your flight attendant any shit stop this silly noknife rule make it public tell the public they rewelcome to bring their pocket knives onboard then everyone will bring themso when you make your intercom call to the passengers for help you ll havea dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new gerbertastes fanatics blood there are even a few of them who d want to keep thefanatics ears as souvenirs none of us is immune take some time and consider your actions if this eventshould ever happen to you my prayer is none of you ever have to face thiskind of decision best of luck to you and may god bless

susan.scott@enron.com,craigl@calpine.com,from astrologycom must i beware of overindulgence in such websitesi like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very truesagittarius and sagittariuswhen two sagittarians join together in a love match the truthloving natures makes theirs a near perfect relationship this couple views the world around them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more knowledge they will engage one another in pleasant conversation and banter that challenges and tickles the mind  an occasional hotheaded dispute can erupt in the sagittariussagittarius relationship when one factfanatic sag partner carries things a little too far easygoing and independent these two are compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests they ve never known jealousy and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with their lover when they are together however they do all they can toward pleasing their partner and satiating common interests  although they are adaptable and modern they can at times fly off the handle however it is not in the archer s nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long sagittarius is ruled by the planet jupiter luck expansion is the key word here as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge they will carry over exciting ideas into their relationship they must be mindful of overindulgences as such gluttony will only distract them their charm and charisma make them a very pleasant couple not only to one another but the entire crowd

honour roll of former chief executives is impressive and lengthening flemming lindelov of carlsberg breweries left for a decorative arts company while jeff skilling resigned from enron last week for personal reasons and the amiable michael bonsignore bade farewell to honeywell while some bosses have been shown the door there appears to be a separate pattern forming  chief executives leaving prematurely because life at the top is too tough and stressful raising the question as to whether the modern ceo has the right stuffand there is the pressing issue of how activist a board should be in these transition issues take for example hewlettpackard directors several of whom this week swore their allegiance to carly fiorina the chief executive whose fate has been the subject of much speculation in venturecapitalbacked companies directors have traditionally been active in recruiting and overseeing financial management taking credit for success and sometimes distancing themselves from blame but in public companies which have fuller management teams directors have tended to take a back seat according to roger kenny managing partner of boardroom consultant a new york firm that recruits directors and senior management boards have become more responsive to their company s performance  and are willing to act institutional investors have been successfully criticising boards for a long time they have put some fibre in the backbone of the directors said kenny directors are now faced with preventing or mitigating ceo disasters in the past boards may have felt beholden to the ceo and been willing to overlook mistakes giving him time to right the ship today a sense of urgency often pervades board meetings when performance slips he added take the case of lucent if lucent s board had removed its ceo earlier in the game would the company be in better shape today asks kenny or xerox should xerox s board have demanded more information about strategic execution from the new ceo before the strategy foundered there are no sure answers but the short period that many ceos remain in the job  on average four years  suggests it is tough to satisfy shareholders and directors particularly during a downturn one of the great revelations of the past year has been the capacity of a ceo to destroy value in a very short period of time said david nadler chairman of mercer delta consultants boards need to act preemptively to reduce the risk of a meltdown the trick lies in the timing some say boards should give ceos more time because the economy can be blamed for failure others argue they should give the ceo less time because the economy makes the situation perilous and there is no time to lose boards struggle to balance acting swiftly to prevent lucentlike situations and not jumping the gun said kenny it s a fine line especially during economic downturns such as the current one kenny says there are a number of steps a board can take to prevent ceo failure including becoming involved in ceo succession and doing whatever it takes to become familiar with the company s core business strategy and tradition is important the hewlettpackard directors insisted

this appalling tragedy occurred that i would monitor the investigation on behalf of my constituents and i have been told that the investigation has established that the cause was the explosion of a transformer i am assured that there is no fundamental hardware problem with the equipment used on the site that would be likely to cause a repetition and this will be reassuring for the people who live and work nearby less that a week after the funeral services of the men who died the mp has revealed that all interviews and investigations of equipment are complete and mr waugh is waiting for

enron renegotiation committee which is expected to submit its report soon has been unable to find a meeting point with the multinational over any of the issues discussed during its meetings according to sources the meetings with enron were doomed right from the word go since enron disagreed with most of the suggestions made by the committee this could have to do with the energy major having already decided to exit the plant and not wanting to make any further compromisesto begin with the committee wanted to scale down the tariff from over rs 4 per unit to rs 207 per unit this was not acceptable to enron which was willing to settle for not more than a 10 per cent reduction in tariff enron representatives told the panel that its landed cost of lng alone worked out to rs 211 per unit in power tariff even the offer made by states outsides maharashtra to buy enron power could not meet with a consensus sources said among the states which approached the panel to buy enron power were delhi mp up rajasthan punjab and karnataka however enron found the purchase rates which ranged from rs 150 to rs 250 impractical the committees demand to remove the dollar denomination in tariff was rejected outright by enron on the grounds that its international lenders would never agree to accept returns in indian currency a debt moratorium for five years as suggested was also ruled out enron was asked to bring down interest rates on its debt component to less than 12 per cent this was ruled out by the multinational which claimed it was less than the cost of its borrowings while the projects indian lenders agreed last year to cut interest rates from 215 per cent to 16 per cent its international lenders charge nine per cent in dollar terms enrons return on equity too has hovered around a low of 12 per cent since the past two years lower than the interest on its debt with a view to reducing the liability of the cashstrapped maharashtra state electricity board mseb the renegotiating committee suggested that the dabhol plant be operated at a lower plant load factor plf of 30 per cent the plf is a major bone of contention between the two parties since the state says it does not need power at a 90 per cent plf and since tariff is predicated on a plf of 90 per cent in the power purchase agreement irrespective of the actual offtake it is learnt that enron was asked to operate the plant at 30 per cent plf from 2002 and scale up to 685 per cent in 2007 to offset the huge tariff burden on mseb this proposal was unpalatable to enron another proposal which was turned down by enron was the suggestion that the returns on its equity be trimmed to 16 per cent in rupee terms at 685 per cent plf as of now the dpc gets 16 per cent returns at 685 per cent plf in dollars with a 07 per cent incentive for every one per cent increase in the plf according to sources the committee discussed abolishing the incentive component bringing down plf and pegging return in indian currency with the multinational mouthing a firm no to most of the proposals it remains to be seen how the godbole report will be implemented and whether the state will see yet another round of protracted litigation on the controversial projectcopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved  india analysispoor governance hobbles india s reform driveby alan wheatley asian economics correspondent08222001reuters english news servicec reuters limited 2001new delhi aug 22 reuters  after six months of political stalemate the rave reviews for finance minister yashwant sinha s reforming budget have given way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps india embraces change only in a crisis in which case a new wave of reforms might not be far awayfor unless growth picks up substantially from last year s 52 percent pace policy experts said india would face a further deterioration in its public finances and rising unemployment that could put the world s largest democracy under serious strain we can t go on without further reforms for very long because we won t be able to grow even by five percent said shashanka bhide chief economist of the national council of applied economic research so the crisis is already there if we re not going to get six percentplus growth rates then it s a political problem there is a broad consensus  on paper  on the need for a second wave of reforms to build on groundbreaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a balanceofpayments crisis in 1991 because its economy is fairly closed india has weathered the current global downturn much better than most of its asian neighbours who would be delighted with five percent growth still output has slowed for two years in a row as postreform momentum has petered out and crucially five percent growth falls far short of the 87 percent average needed over the next decade to achieve prime minister atal behari vajpayee s goal of doubling per capita income currently around 460 a year eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed which means there will be greater social unrest said p chidambaram a former finance minister a five percent growth rate while statistically acceptable is simply politically unacceptable and socially unacceptable competitive politics it was to raise the economy s speed limit that sinha unveiled in his february budget a raft of farreaching structural reforms making it easier to fire workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for small and mediumsized firms the reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in india but they soon became mired in what the planning commission aptly calls the compulsion of competitive politics on a charitable view the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kaleidoscope that is india s multiparty democracy this is not a country this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in the political domain the social domain and the economic domain said amit mitra secretary general of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry less charitably the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfeebled vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy 19party coalition and force ministers to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests opposed to change arjun sengupta a professor at the centre for policy research said the absence of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its own furrow resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly needed investment this is the main problem we have today we do not have a coherent unified policy framework sengupta said he said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult because india s most populous and backward states were falling farther and farther behind the betteroff ones if the centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the states we are facing major problems which can become explosive sengupta a former ambassador and imf official said peering through the gloom optimists point to the precedent of legislation passed without the pressure of a crisis in 1999 to open up india s insurance market to foreign firms they hope two equally controversial reform bills to liberalise the crisisridden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms will also eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week ending months of wrangling anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn t looked at figures on poverty very closely said planning commission member nk singh he said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to 27 percent from 37 percent reform priorities the list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy because of its pivotal role in the economy the power sector is many experts  number one priority the wellcatalogued troubles that foreign firms such as enron corp have encountered dealing with india s allbutbankrupt state power boards have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twice as much as they would in china for electricity nevertheless attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political rocks how to end overmanning at the power boards estimated at 5070 percent and how to charge users mainly farmers market rates for stolen or heavily subsidised power dk srivastava a professor at the national institute of public finance and policy said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be assured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek reelection two or three years later any government under any minister will say to you how can i survive unless i can show my voters jobs  srivastava said this is one of the basic constraints on power sector reform tk bhaumik a senior adviser at the confederation of indian industry agreed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the case for change to india s mass poor we did not articulate the economic reform process to the people bhaumik said on privatisation for instance policymakers did not spell out the consequences for jobs i don t think we really understood the issues properly we simply followed the washington consensus and that didn t go down well with the people he said as divestment minister arun shourie knows only too well the privatisation programme he oversees a litmus test of india s reform will is stalled because of what shourie calls fractured politics and noise generated by corporate interests shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt india s politicians into putting the country s interests first we re on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and i feel the real circumstances in which india is placed will force the political

investigate first we started with generators then expanded to traders and we re also going to look at the state s utilities we ve already made document requests of the los angeles department of water and power and the sacramento municipal utility district dunn saiddunn said the ladwp hasn t provided all documents to the committee though they have indicated they are happy to cooperate it s taken ladwp a while it doesn t seem to be the case that they are withholding those documents though we don t have them all dunn said no one at ladwp was available to comment on the matter the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation has cited enron corp ene and reliant energy rei with contempt for refusing to provide certain documents if the full senate approves those contempt charges the companies could be punished most likely with fines a study by trade group independent energy producers association found that reliant and enron power marketing inc charged the state s powerbuying arm less than the average price of 269 a megawatthour for electricity in january through march the ladwp and smud charged more than the average the committee s next hearing will be in the first week of september dunn said hearings throughout the fall will concentrate on depositions he added by jessica berthold dow jones newswires 3236583872 jessicabertholddowjonescom 0 220801 0117gcopyright  2000

newswires washington dow jones four of the five california department of water resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operator s control roomthat revelation was contained in a recent letter to the house government reform committee from terry winter the california independent system operator s president and chief executive the letter responded to house lawmakers  concerns voiced during an aug 2 hearing about dwr power traders having access to the iso s control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there rep doug ose rcalif who chairs the committee s energy policy panel said access to the iso s control room allowed dwr traders to cherrypick power purchases and led federal regulators to exclude dwr purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order the five fired dwr traders owned stock in calpine corp cpn a major power provider in california the four fired dwr employees with access to the iso control room were william mead herman leung constantine louie and peggy chung the fifth richard ferreiro wasn t among those winter listed as having controlroom access neither did elaine griffin who resigned after it was learned she owned calpine stock they were among 14 dwr employees who had their controlroom access privileges terminated by the iso over the past two months the others had their badges deactivated because they either hadn t filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadn t been using their badges to access the iso control room said stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman nine dwr power traders still enjoy access to the iso control room according to winter s letter to ose among them is bernard barretto who reportedly owns stock in enron corp ene steve maviglio a spokesman for california gov gray davis who recently sold calpine stock after conflictofinterest concerns were raised said earlier this month that barretto s investment met state ethics rules because enron wasn t making sales in the spot market where the dwr employee was involved in making power purchases dwr employees  investments are thoroughly reviewed to make sure there are no conflicts dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests hidalgo said an ose spokesman yier shi said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of california consumers it s pretty obvious that it isn t in the interest of california consumers the dwr or the iso to have that conflict of interest in the powerpurchasing process shi said why is dwr getting preferential access that s the core issue shi added allowing dwr power traders into the iso control room is a real conflict because dwr is the major buyer in the state said lynne church president of the electric power supply association whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in california having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorterterm markets are charging including what s being sold and to whom church said any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access she said noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access it s just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence during the aug 2 hearing that ose chaired winter agreed that having dwr employees in the control room was a problem the iso is working very hard to get them out he said the access was provided back in january after the dwr was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about 10 billion in power on behalf of the state s bankrupt and nearbankrupt investorowned utilities pacific gas  electric co pcg and southern california edison co eix power providers were balking at continuing to sell power to california unless they were assured of creditworthy buyers and the dwr refused to take on the responsibility unless the iso granted the agency access to the control room winter told ose s subcommittee the arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts he said the dwr will withdraw its employees from the iso control room effective sept 1 pete garris who oversees power purchases for the dwr announced over the weekend it wasn t our intent to be there on a permanent basis said hidalgo the dwr spokesman who described the privilege as a temporary move to keep the lights on now that the state s electricity crisis has lessened the dwr s goal is to have the traders out of the iso control room by sept 1 hidalgo said we re pleased to see that the dwr is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the iso said shi the ose aide we hope this change of policy isn t too little too late for california consumers to win refunds by bryan lee dow jones newswires 2028626647 bryanleedowjonescomcopyright  2000 dow

just the way many utilities like itby daniel fisher and lynn cook06112001forbes080copyright 2001 forbes incour energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient unfortunately many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way the bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production that alone won t solve the nation s power crunch supply is not the only issue says michelle michot soss director of the energy institute at the university of houston the issue is bottleneckssome of these bottlenecks are political a lot of them are created by incumbent utilities that do not welcome competition florida for example whose demand for electricity is growing at about 37 a year is a net importer of energy it generates around 24 of its power in aging oilfired plants that should be replaced with more efficient combinedcycle generators these burn natural gas in a turbine and use the hot exhaust gases to create steam which spins a second turbine they spew out less particulate and consume about a third less energy so why doesn t florida get efficient power plants first the state has only one main gas pipeline though others are working their way through the regulatory process more vexing is a state law zealously defended by florida utilities that bans outside competitors from building combinedcycle plants larger than 75 megawattsenough to juice 75000 householdson the dubious theory that they waste water duke energy tried to challenge the law with a 500megawatt plant in new smyrna beach fpl corp parent of florida power  light fought the plant all the way to the florida supreme court and won florida s screwy powerplant law is just one example of the byzantine regulations that stymie efforts to make the nation s energy grid more efficient and prices more competitive from laws that protect utilities against more efficient rivals to outdated state regulations that discourage the construction of transmission lines these choke points either waste energy or make it impossible for energy to get where it should go a series of state laws in the 1920s laid down the monopolies on grids they were codified in the public utility holding company act of 1935 a populist law that identified bigness with badness in the electricity business to avoid federal scrutiny and regulation most utilities decided not to operate outside their own state boundaries rate setting fell to the states but even as wholesale electricity markets have been deregulated utilities can still bat away outsiders by reserving their own transmission lines for native load this allows them to keep an open lane on the energy highway as it were to rush electricity to certain customers when their demand suddenly spikes in such areas as the southeast the owner of a transmission line has a pretty free hand in calculating what its native load is so southern co which owns utilities in georgia and four neighboring states can determine how much power to let into its territory southern co defends the rule saying its primary job is ensuring customers get all the power they need the marketers would like to schedule another 10000 megawatts of power to go across our lines tomorrow says william newman a senior vice president it s not going to happen the system wasn t designed for it enron disagrees utilization of its natural gas pipeline system increased 50 in the five years after the gas market was deregulated steven kean head of government regulations at the houstonbased giant thinks similar gains are possible in electricity if companies like southern are forced to hand over control of the grid to independent regional boards that will determine how to allocate power flows and where to build new lines the utilities don t want to accept the economically pure solution he says once utilities have been adequately compensated for their stranded costs then it s time for them to shut up sit in the corner and let the economists and lawyers work out the details lawyers and economists making decisions for us that doesn t sound like deregulation but there is a case to be made for separating control of power lines from control of other utility assets phillip g harris is chief executive of pjm it stood for pennsylvaniajerseymaryland a regional power line organization since this independent system operator was formed in april 1997 and six local utilities ceded control over transmission lines reliability has gone up and prices down he says where southern co will only add transmission capacity if it has a firm contract in hand pjm can order lines to be built its member companies are spending 311 million over the next three years on new lines to increase the flow from powerrich to energypoor areas last may temperatures hit the highest levels since 1930 at the same time as 15000 megawatts of pjm s 59000 megawatts were out of service for maintenance as the peak load rose to 51000 megawatts7000 more than was available within pjmpower streamed in over a dozen entry points prices topped out at 432 a megawatt hour that s about four times what you are probably paying for residential service but it stands in contrast to spikes in the thousands of dollars in california and the midwest during similar crises unfortunately what works inside pjm doesn t transfer to los angeles much less to manhattan different rules regarding electricity transactions and a shortage of transmission lines make it difficult to export electricity across the hudson river when hydroquebec tried to build a power line across long island sound in 1999 connecticut nixed the idea ostensible reason the possibility of harm to oyster beds real reason folks in new haven asked what s in it for usand didn t see any clear benefit to them there is unfortunately no mechanism for buying off losers in these deals such as property owners near but not under the power line so they hire lawyers and talk solemnly about oysters california s bottleneck is on path 15 a 500000volt transmission line that links the northern and southern halves of the state path 15 can t accommodate the flows of power needed when the weather is cool in san francisco and hot in la but the legal and financial chaos in california with the state on the verge of taking over much of the transmission system discourages investors from backing an increase in capacity if we put in good rules on how to operate transmission systems you would see investment says lawrence makovich an analyst with cambridge energy research associates the problem is right now there is no such plan enron is trying to force the federal energy regulatory commission to take charge so far to little avail in a case pending before the us supreme court enron accuses ferc of abdicating its responsibility to do for interstate trading of electricity what it did for trading of gas but forcing ferc down that path will be difficult natural gas producers needed interstate pipelines to get to big markets in the north which needed the gas but incumbent and politically connected electric companies have no such incentive to stimulate a national market in electricity there s not a single incentive in the entire us to

with the industry it regulates despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity and natural gas markets in california and the west and a finding by ferc last november of  unjust and unreasonable  electricity rates the commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and stability to the marketplace feinstein said in a letter to sen joe lieberman dconn seeking hearings by the senate governmental affairs committeefeinstein cited a report in the new york times friday in which ferc chairman curt hebert related a phone conversation with ken lay chairman of enron corp ene hebert alleged that lay offered to bring his influence to bear with the bush administration to maintain hebert as chairman if the regulator would adopt policy positions favored by enron hebert is quoted as saying he was offended by the conversation lay disputed hebert s account the times article also quoted vice president dick cheney as saying texas utility regulator pat wood has got to be the next chairman of the ferc to address problems in electricity markets cheney s remark is slated for broadcast by the public television program frontline while mr lay s account of the conversation differs it is clear that the citizens of the united states especially the people of california who are suffering from ferc s failure to do its job deserve an investigation and full public hearing into what happened feinstein said in the letter to lieberman ferc is a 175 millionayear agency charged with regulating the energy industry and it would be unconscionable if any of the nation s electricity traders or generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs or becomes a member of the commission feinstein wrote since ferc has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the federal power act to restore  just and reasonable  electricity rates we need to ask whether undue influence by the companies that ferc regulates has resulted in its failure to act the letter said feinstein seeks a broad investigation into ferc and not just an airing of the layhebert exchange which feinstein said she sees as an example of a definite problem the senator s spokesman howard gantman said there are very close relationships between ferc and the industry it regulates some of those relationships could be improper gantman said lieberman who has requested that the general accounting office investigate ferc s response to the california electricity crisis will become chairman of the governmental affairs committee when democrats assume the

completed at the start of next monththe real was at 23480 against the dollar in afternoon trade down about 20 pct from the end of last year analysts said the weakness of the real combined with a generallyaccepted slowdown in gdp growth as a result of the energy crisis has complicated the task of the central bank s monetary policy committee copom the copom raised its base interbank selic rate

year s presidential elections they said corruption allegations involving former and current senior officials in the government and the alleged breach of vote secrecy rules at the senate resulting in proceedings for the dismissal of former senate chairman antonio carlos magalhaes and senator jose roberto arruda have complicated the political scenario yesterday senator arruda resigned from the

parties within the ruling coalition withdrew their support for the motion opposition deputy aloizio mercadante at the time said the pt was preparing legal action against the government and the

reviewed abe s and eduardo s comments on the joint security assessment report i would like to provide my commentsthe things you should look at doing1 get the government involved in enforcing the laws and stopping the illegal behavior  let the government decide how to do that  whether through the national police or the military  get the government involved is not quite the same as bring in the army  although that may be a part of the final decision  pointing out to the government that the project is important to bolivia as well at to enronshell may help to get them off dead center2 expand your pr program to include education of the people about illegal acts and their consequences  obviously if the government doesn t want to get involved there won t be any consequences and in that case you might as well skip this step  you may already have assets in place to do this  the clo s and jose castro of gob  a little more push with the local civic committee to get them to accept your bringing in an outside member3 consider bringing in outside security people from santa cruz wackenhut can get you national police on contract to ride  shotgun  on the vehicles and protect work sites and offices if you feel a physical threat exists to your employees  the cost will be high as you will have to provide housing food and transportation in addition to salary  this would help in reducing the number of  carjackings  of your vehicles and threats to your employees  this might however have a negative impact overall and the confrontations may turn violent if the youth organization won t back down from a fight  escalation at this point in the construction might lead to a longer completion time than if you just  go with the flow   in my opinion i would use this only if the government doesn t get involved in crime suppression activities4 refuse to continue paying extortion to the populace  bear in mind however that this decision will probably escalate future incidents with results equivilent to those mentioned above in 3the above are my immediate recommendations  the below are my general comments i think the problem is more than just the  pr issue  that the report seems to indicate  there are illegal acts being committed in violation of bolivian laws by a populace who is used to doing things their own way without the benefit of following laws made by the government far away who doesn t take an active interest in crime suppression  the only remedy for committing illegal acts is punishment for the offender which sends a message to the community that illegal acts will not be condoned  can enron punish the offender  no  that can only come from the government through their legal system  enron should not be required to submit to extortion by groups committing illegal acts  enron s push here should be to get the government involved at whatever level it takes to investigate and prosecute those committing the illegal acts   you have a short time frame to work in before the project is complete  putting things in motion now wouldn t guarantee they would be in place before the end of the project  however the operator of the pipeline is going to have to face these or similar issues  they are not going to go away just because the pipeline is finished  the acceptance by the general populace of use of illegal acts can easily become a breeding ground for future sabotage of the pipeline kidnapping of employees and contractors  whatever shortterm solution you use will affect the longterm security of the pipeline and needs to be well considered  whatever other options you have education of the people probably wouldn t hurt  if the operator of the pl can get involved in the education of the populace it would be in it s best interest to do so your subcontractor conduto seems to be a focal point for at least some of the problems through their nonuse of local labor  there is no indication in the report or in abe s comments that the local populace are qualified for available jobs    maybe a lesson learned for next project  try to use local labor where possible and qualified  this friction  between conduto and the populace  seems to be the major issue the clo concept as i understand abe s comments seems to be on the right track but maybe their responsibility should be expanded to include educating the populace that there is a difference in nogotiating for something in good faith rather than under duress  also that illegal acts will not be tolerated  one potential problem i see is that if gob refuses to negotiate over future issues wants of the people then without the education part of it in place you will probably see sabotage on the pl or of company vehicles and possibly violence against your employees  obviously you want to continue to use people such as jose castro  possibly expanding his role to include education issuesin any case this is not a problem that is going to go away overnight and any actions you take at this point may not have a positive effect by the time the project is complete  hindsight is always better  maybe for the next project we will consider a due diligence assessment of the areas our pipe will pass through and see if similar conditions exist therehope to see you before longregardsmike hickslaine a powellenrondevelopment03142000 0325 amto michael hicksectcc abraham

summary california treasurer angelides sets dates for bridge loans  bonds california s supreme court may see challenge to plan bangelides on bridge loans and bondsca treasurer angelides has said that beginning 15 august the state will set up a bridge loan  the revenue bonds will not be issued until september or october  angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in july or august  however he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in october and november  this is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the dwr and from other parts of the government not on payment terms for power  he fears there will be a cash management problemcalifornia supreme court to challenge plan bcalifornia attorney michael sturmwasser is expected to challenge plan b before the california supreme court on the basis that it results in a retroactive rate increase and that it removes the puc s authority to review power purchases  this is because plan b enables socal to collect a dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going forward  socal and pge would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate component to be able to operate going forward and remain creditworthy  this takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off the state s balance sheet a key goal of lawmakers  however at the same time it also abrogates the puc from its responsibility to review power purchases  the state cannot give the utilities a blank check in the form of a dedicated rate component to operate without taking authority away from the puc  according to the california constitution the legislature can add to the responsibilities of the puc but it cannot take away powers from the puc  at the same time ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for power that they have already used  sources describe sturmwasser s case as arguable in other words it has a fair chance of succeeding  however regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails it is very likely to cloud the issue of the bailout and significantly deflate the prospects of the plan bif ferc were to impose costbased controls on power prices sources believe it might go a long way toward avoiding these problems  were this to happen the puc could declare ferc s rates just and reasonable which would likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep socal liquid  however such measures by ferc require significant lead time  sources state that the state needs to tease the feds into doing this  this can be done by conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data ferc would use for determining the cost controls  sources report that this process of teasing ferc has not yet started  this is chiefly because california politicians are focused on flat price caps which ferc is very unlikely to impose  it appears the state is asking ferc for the wrong measures which is delaying the process  the only way for the state to avoid these constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities as municipal entities would not be subject to puc regulation  however there remains very significant opposition to this idea especially on the republican side  a state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain momentum once plan b began to fail for the reasons cited above  additionally a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were both utilities in bankruptcysturmwasser is a partner at sturmwasser  woocher a santa monica law firm  his offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in santa monica overlooking the beach  he has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years  his clients include the consumer advocacy group turn toward utilities rate normalcy among others  sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to support the legal challenge but if he cannot find money elsewhere he will likely be able to support it out of his own pocket

mark of course in doing the reuters telephone interview yesterday morning at eva s request for more than an hour i made all of the critical explanatory points and more you mention below the temptation of the quote from the commission official was obviously irresistible for one of the journalists pomeroy however on the positive side however mention of traders  objections to level and incidence of the proposed tariff its discriminatory effect and absence of agreement about implementation in germany are attributable to my briefing of the other journalist orgillthe quoted official is giving the dominique ristori a commission energy policy director of french nationality party line but our victory is attributable to decisions taken in the cabinet of loyola de palacio the energy commissioner with whom i intervened on behalf of efet two weeks ago and who had already been confronted in september by british government objections as such it no longer matters objectively what m ristori and his spokespersons think about the demise of the 2 euros as you and i discussed yesterday we must now move on rapidly to offer an alternative traders system users  solution for establishment of non discriminatory cross border transmission tariffs an efet paper for this purpose is already in preparation and i spoke to the cabinet of mario monti competition commissioner about the principles

eu plans for single power market suffer setback enron mention reutersthis articlewire report from reuters came in yesterday just as i left for a lecture so i am only now forwarding it to you  joe tells me that investor relations has received some inquiries about what is going on in europe yesterday due to the bad headline reuters chose below aided by a selfserving european commission official and dynegy s q3 earnings showing red ink for europe  ignoring the headline and the quote from the european commission civil servant which i will elaborate upon below this is a big win it is progress for liberalisation and i intend to tell the economist just that when i do an interview with a reporter later today  this story is about the demise of the illconceived 2eurosmwh export charge  it stands truth and logic on its head to say as the unnamed european official does that the demise of the 2 euros charge was anything like harmonisation or that its demise sets back european liberalisattion  it is now much more likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase trade and certainly will not set back trade as the 2 euros would have  just to further deconstruct the article it was never a single charge recall that new entrants disproportionately bore the burden with many preexisting contracts of incumbents since we did not exist in this market 3 years ago being exempt nor would it contribute to a single market but rather would have raised barriers to crossborder trade  moreover the cost basis for the charge was never made transparent either  finally the rebate scheme likely would have subsidised the incumbents  competition against new entrants  there is a good quote from peter styles and peter deserves a great deal of recognition for leading the efforts to defeat this  if you read the article not the headline and european commission official quote you can see the other arguments against it including the claim by german industrial consumers that it would have raised their prices by 10  any message from pr or investor relations must be that this is a victory in the march towards a fully liberalised market and a win for consumers  the reason a european ommission official would say what they did is that they have been complicit in the germanfranco conspiracy to impose the 2 euros charge and probably felt compelled to save face by saying this is a setback otherwise one would ask why were they working onsupporting something so deleterious to the development of the marketapologies for being a bit lengthy but i wrote this hopefully with sufficient detail that if you want to forward this to either pr or investor relations they will be armed with enough info that they can respond to further inquiries  by the way we had an inkling of this via telephone coversation i had with uk dti three days ago communicated immediately to traders just did not have time to summarise in an email to you  i will be summarising my conversation with uk dti momentarily even though it is 3 days old because i will be adding some of her commentary on the wider political lay of the land which i think you will want to read for the big picture of european machinations  let me know if you need more  thanks  mcs      forwarded by mark schroederlonect on 27102000 1036 iona maclean26102000 1735to peter styleslonectect jackie

busterenrondevelopmentenrondevelopmentcc  subject sac bee tues 213 editorial lawmakers failed to respond to energy alarmlawmakers failed to respond to energy alarmpublished feb 13 2001 now that state lawmakers have begun an inquiry to determine what caused california s energy crisis they might want to take a look in the mirror not at the infamous 1996 vote that triggered the partial deregulation of the electricity industry the remains of that law have been picked over enough besides most of the people who voted for it have already left the legislature thanks to term limits but there was another vote last june far less heralded and still little known it came just as warning bells were starting to signal the onset of what has since become a crippling crisis the legislature not only ignored those alarms it stood in the way of the people who were trying to respond why it did so remains something of a mystery how it did so says a lot about the way the legislature works at issue was the nowdefunct california power exchange this was a statemandated auction until recently the only place that utilities were allowed to shop for the electricity that lights our homes and businesses by last june there were ominous signs that the power exchange known as the px wasn t working right prices were higher than anyone expected the supply of energy seemed thinner than was reasonable there were enormous overhead costs the power exchange was a bit like having a single automobile auction where everyone who wanted to buy or sell a car had to do business in times of surplus this might work because the sellers would underbid each other to unload their cars to reluctant buyers but in a shortage the opposite would be true buyers with no place else to go would pay everhigher prices to get what they needed that s what was happening with electricity a majority of the public utilities commission decided to do something about it the puc voted 32 to allow privately formed exchanges to compete with the statesanctioned auction at least two private exchanges were promising to deliver more power at lower prices with fewer administrative costs the commission wanted to let them give it a try but before the puc could even implement the change the legislature intervened acting with unusual speed lawmakers overturned the commission s decision assembly bill 2866 was a classic legislative bill in the worst sense a cobbledtogether collection of 28 unrelated items it was drafted in a hurry as a companion to the new state budget one of the bill s many parts was a provision to subsidize california s film industry that got a lot of attention the paragraph overturning the puc s attempt to head off the energy crisis got next to none the bill was amended in the senate on june 15 and approved later that day the assembly passed it the next day and gov gray davis signed it the analysis of the bill that members saw in the assembly was cryptic and misleading it said the bill would authorize the puc to study the idea of allowing competition for the statemandated exchange that was true as far as it went but the analysis omitted the fact that the bill s real intent was just the opposite to reverse a puc decision and prohibit competing exchanges for at least a year california had made a big investment in the power exchange said sen jim brulte rrancho cucamonga who was one of probably just a handful of legislators who knew about the provision before it became law the puc decision would have put that investment at risk which is another way of saying that the power exchange wasn t working and had to be protected from competition richard bilas the puc commissioner who was pushing the hardest for the reform the legislature overturned said he never liked the idea of mandating a single exchange in which the utilities would have to buy all their power bilas wasn t a member of the commission when the puc restructured california s electricity industry but he said the result reminded him of the former soviet union where leaders declared that they were going to move to a market economy and then appointed a group of central planners to figure out how those markets should function markets are not based on fictitious or created exchanges he said markets are based on buyers and sellers coming face to face to negotiate a deal you don t establish beforehand something that may not be necessary it s still not clear whether opening up the markets would have prevented the price spikes that have since nearly bankrupted the utilities forcing the state to step in and buy electricity to keep the lights on it might be a stretch to suggest that any single policy change could have prevented the crisis but we will never know the legislature acting in haste and with little information kept us from finding out the california power exchange which the legislature was so eager to protect from competition collapsed of its own weight anyway and is now out of

john.lavorato@enron.com,rick.buy@enron.com,the ppa auction is going along well i think  we are leading on sundance b and have been for 3 rounds now  some weird things are occuring so it is too early to tell what will utimately happen  the government has said that it will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning  we would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on sundance b  currently we are bid  112000000 canadian and a swap price of 335 cad  but again its too early to get our hopes up
kim.melodick@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,john below are several issues i wanted to bring to your attention prior to finalizing merit increases for east power  i have also given david oxley the same information in order for you to discuss this morning when you meet  call me if you have any questions m dana davis s employment agreement will expire in february 28 2001  i imagine we will want to renew with the new salary on the employment agreement  k presto would like to recommendation that we give him a 20000 increaserogers herndon  s employment agreement  will expire september 14 2001  do we want to renew earlier and roll the base salary changes if any into the employment agreement kevin presto would like to give him a 15000 increasewho will be responsible for john zufferli s increase if any  since he transferred to canada and now has been promoted to vprob benson was given a significant increase in the global comp system at the insistence of kpresto  kevin states that john lavorato indicated to him that benson needed to be taken care of  with that being said kevin would like to bring him up more in line with a commerical director which he was just promoted to  his employment agreement will expire 2101  so would it also make sense to delete him from the merit database and renew an employment agreement rolling in his new salaryfinally i need you to decide on chris dorland s new salary  he is currently making 81000 and i have recommended 90000  he is an associate that is being made a commerical manager  he was ranked superior and presto has indicated that he is expecting around 100000  presto finally settled on 95000 provided you concur  our plan prior was slightly stagger salaries for individuals as associates promoted to commercial manager based on final rankings  85000 strong 87500 for excellent 90000 for superior the guideline from the program is 86000 but is left up to the business unit discretion

bnaeuro swap spreads seen sideways us to narrow  reutersfed s greenspan s speech to bond market assn  reutersenron offers structured weather note  derivatives weekliquidity  the isda master agreementderivatives week  april 30 2001ensuring liquidity should be the primary goal in negotiating an isda masteragreement the agreement for smaller nonrated customers such as ahedge fund or a middlemarket corporation often highly leveraged and withlittle room for error these customers should focus their efforts whennegotiating the agreement with a dealer on limiting the dealer s opportunityto terminate the agreement unfortunately however customers typicallythrough expensive outside counsel often instead use up valuablenegotiating capital on esoteric legal issues that may only remotely affect acustomer s situationa dealer typically wants the right to terminate the agreement at the firstsign of its customer s economic difficulties such as a cross default or adecline in the customer s net worth because of the fluctuating nature ofderivatives a dealer wants to quickly terminate any growing exposure fromoutstanding transactions as its customer s credit deteriorates earlytermination of its agreement with the dealer however may only further acustomer s growing liquidity crisisupon early termination a customer that is outofthemoney on its tradeswith the dealer may end up having to make large termination paymentsdepending on its agreements with other dealers an early termination couldpossibly give other dealers the right to terminate their agreements with thecustomer even if the customer is in the money it may not be able toreplace important terminated hedging transactions termination of theagreement may be the beginning of the end for a customer in economicdifficultycross defaultone of the most important signs of a customer s financial deterioration fora dealer is the occurrence of a cross default by the customer with one ofits other creditors under the agreement a cross default takes place uponthe occurrence or existence of an event of default with respect tospecified indebtedness for the provision to apply however the partiesmust affirmatively elect for the cross default provision to apply to eitheror both partiesthe parties must also agree on the definition of specified indebtednessspecified indebtedness is defined in the agreement to be any obligationwhether present or future contingent or otherwise as principal or suretyor otherwise in respect of borrowed money dealers often will want toexpand the definition beyond the concept of borrowed money to includeobligations under other types of financial transactions such as forwardsrepurchase agreements securities lending agreements or even exchangederivatives such as futures and options dealers may even try to define itto include any contractual obligations of the customer the broader thedefinition of specified indebtedness the more likely that a cross defaultwill occur to the customerin addition many of the new types of obligations added to the definition ofspecified indebtedness such as repos are prone to technical defaultsalthough these technical defaults are generally cured or waived in theordinary course of business they could provide an aggressive dealer with anopportunity to terminate the agreement upon their occurrencethe parties must also agree on appropriate cross default thresholds this isthe amount that a default must exceed before it will constitute a crossdefault although the dealer will want a threshold of 23 of its equity foritself it will insist on a more modest number for the customer ranging from020 million the smaller the threshold the more likely that a crossdefault will occur to the customerin addition as with all cross default provisions the customer should becareful that the agreed upon threshold amount not be lower than its crossdefault threshold in its other finance agreements for example if thethreshold were lower in the agreement than the threshold under its loanagreement a small payment default on specified indebtedness might triggerthe cross default under the agreement which in turn might inadvertentlytrigger the cross default under its other finance agreementsa customer should insist that a cross default only occur upon the crossacceleration of the other indebtedness as opposed to merely the existenceof a default under the standard cross default language in the agreement anevent of default can occur upon a default under other indebtednessirrespective of whether the other creditor accelerates the specifiedindebtedness by requiring that the default result in an acceleration of theunderlying indebtedness a dealer would not be able to terminate theagreement until the other creditor actually accelerated the specifiedindebtednessdealers generally resist a cross acceleration requirement because it limitstheir ability to concurrently negotiate with its customer during anyworkout discussions the customer might be having with another lender forexample a creditor could persuade the customer to pledge additionalcollateral in exchange for not accelerating the indebtedness if the dealercould not declare a cross default under the agreement at that same time itwould not be able to negotiate the same terms with the customer as did theother customer s creditorscredit event upon mergera credit event upon merger is a termination event under the agreement itoccurs if a party participates in a merger or enters into a similar type oftransaction and the resulting entity is materially weaker after theevent the rationale for the provision is that a party may not have enteredinto the agreement with the customer that is now materially weaker becauseof a merger like the cross default the parties must elect for the creditevent upon merger to applyunfortunately the term materially weaker is not defined in the agreementthe dealer may attempt to define an objective test that would measure whenthe resulting entity becomes materially weaker for example the resultingentity would be considered materially weaker if its credit rating werematerially affected or if it failed designated financial covenantsthe parties may also want to expand what is meant by a credit event uponmerger the dealer may suggest that recapitalizations through the issuanceof new forms of stock or debt would constitute a credit event upon merger acustomer may want to resist such a definitional change because of thepotential restrictions it could pose on its ability to change its capitalstructure the occurrence of such a change in its capitalization howeverwould still require the resulting entity to be materially weaker toconstitute a termination eventadditional termination eventsa dealer may insist on adding additional termination events additionaltermination events are generally treated under the agreement similar toevents of default if an additional termination event has occurred withrespect to a party that party is referred to as the affected party uponthe occurrence of such an event the dealer would have the right toterminate the agreement at a time precisely when the customer most needs tomaintain its liquiditythe most common additional termination events negotiated are those thatresult from a change in the financial condition of the affected party thiscould be triggered by a credit downgrading or by the failure to maintain acertain level of capital or net worth or a failure to maintain certainfinancial ratiosan additional termination event could also result from a problem unique tothe counterparty such as the failure of an affected party to maintain acertain legal or regulatory status failure to notify the nonaffected partyof certain events or to deliver certain information could also be anadditional termination event finally if the affected party is dependant onthe leadership or direction of certain individuals the resignation or deathof such individuals could also result in early terminationson of first methoddesignating first method as a method for determining damages upon thetermination of the agreement has become obsolete the effect of first methodwas to deprive the defaulting party of any payments upon the termination ofthe agreement in the event that the defaulting party was in the moneynow however dealers are often insisting on the right to delay makingpayments to a customer upon an early termination of the agreement until thedealer is completely satisfied that the defaulting party has no furtherpayment obligations to it something that could takes days or even weeks toresolvedelaying payments on an early termination date however can result insignificant liquidity problems for a customer upon an early termination ofthe agreement if the customer is in the money it is probable that acustomer may be counting on the dealer s payment in order to meet anyobligations it has on the early termination date to other parties if suchpayments were withheld by the dealer the customer would be unable to usesuch amounts to meet its obligations with other counterparties perhapstriggering additional defaults under other agreements for the customerlimiting cure periodsthe agreement was drafted by isda with cure periods much more liberal thanmay be typically seen in other finance contracts due to what drafters viewedas the unique characteristics of the otc derivatives market dealershowever have begun to limit these cure periods for example instead ofpermitting a customer three business days to cure a payment default thedealers are narrowing it to one similarly dealers are requesting only afiveday cure period for breach of certain other provisions while theagreement normally provides for 30 narrowing of such cure periods may notbe in a customer s best interest these more limited cure periods areprobably not sufficiently long for a customer experiencing economicdifficulties to resolve the underlying defaultsalthough there are numerous legal issues affecting the isda master agreementthat are negotiated the most probable issues that may affect a smallercustomer deal with terminating the agreement upon the occurrence of somefinancial difficulty because of that the customer should focus its effortson limiting as much as possible these early termination opportunitiesderegulation fails to deliverfinancial times  april 30 2001by geoff dyerthe lights are not blazing at the presidential palace in the brasilianighttime as they once did it is not because the staff are taking it easyhowever the economy measure is aimed simply at saving energy this is morethan just a symbolic gesture since the beginning of april all governmentoffices from that of the lowest bureaucrat to huge those in stateownedcorporations have been under orders to cut energy consumption by 10 percentprivate sector companies and ordinary households are also being urged totrim their energy usage before the lights go out involuntarilythe saving measures are brazil s lastditch attempt to stave off afullblown energy crisis and has prompted many comparisons with the partialderegulation disaster in california yet even with these cutbacksministers have already admitted that brazil will need some form of energyrationing later in the year to avoid the risk of serious blackoutsthe official culprit for the energy shortage is the weather patchy rainfallhas left the reservoirs in the industrialised southeast of the country onlya third full when they should normally be at half their capacity at thistime of year given that more than 90 per cent of brazil s energy comes fromhydroelectric plants this presents a serious problembehind the unreliable weather however lies a generation ofunderinvestment the debt crisis in the early 1980s cut off foreignfinancing for the sector while the fiscal problems that came with rampantinflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s constrained the state s abilityto investliberalisation and privatisation during the past six years have not resolvedthe problem in the period 1995 to 1999 according to the nationaldevelopment bank bndes growth in generating capacity was 34 per cent ayear while electricity consumption expanded annually by 44 per centlike california the deregulation of the brazilian energy sector has been ahalfway house that has pleased neither supporters or critics while most ofthe electricity distribution companies have been sold off to the likes ofaes of the us and spain s endesa the bulk of generation capacity  wheremost of the new investment is needed  remains in public handspolitical disputes have led to the persistent postponement of plans to sellfurnas in the southeast and chesf in the northeast meanwhile thegovernment s fiscal austerity drive  agreed with and painstakinglymonitored by the international monetary fund  has tied its hands frommaking the necessary new investmentsthe regulatory environment has also been heavily criticised the governmenthad been hoping to encourage a boom in gaspowered plants especially usingthe boliviabrazil gas pipeline which was opened in 1999 however the newthermal plants have come on stream more slowly than expected partly becausewouldbe investors were worried about having to pay for the gas in dollarswhile their revenues would be in realsneither has the government induced the investments in transmission networksthat might have alleviated the situation the south of the country hasactually experienced normal rainfall this year however as sandra boentean analyst with salomon smith barney noted in a recent reportunfortunately there is not enough transmission capacity to shift thatexcess power supply to the consumption centres in the southeastat least businesses cannot claim to have been surprised by the potentialenergy crisis industry groups have been warning their members for severalyears not to believe government pledges that there would be no rationingas a result a some companies have invested heavily to create their owngeneration facilities ambev the largest brewer in latin america isspending rdollars 60m on 10 different gasfired power plants at itsfactories with a total capacity of 61mw which it hopes to have in operationby the end of next year the plants will cover twothirds of its energyneeds and also save up to 20 per cent on its production costsanother government tactic has been to lean on petrobras the stateowned oiland gas giant to take part in more thermoelectric plant projects thecompany has been authorised to invest in a further two plants with capacityof more than 1000mw which takes the total number of plants in which it isinvolved to 12yet it is petrobras which has also contributed to the growing sense ofunease about both the country s energy sector and the government sliberalisation policies the sinking of the world s largest offshore oilproduction platform off the coast of rio de janeiro in march was a huge blowto national selfesteem president fernando henrique cardoso described theevent as our challenger in a reference to the explosion of the us spaceshuttlethe accident followed a string of environmental disasters at petrobrasoperations including a massive oil spill in rio s guanabara bay whichendangered some of the city s beaches and while the oil rig was staffed byemployees of the company many of the accidents have occurred at facilitieswhere the operations have been outsourced to thirdparty companiesin the public eye at least the result has been to tarnish the deregulationof the sector which has seen petrobras lose its monopoly on exploration andproduction of oil and a new management team try to make the company moretransparent and efficientthe newlook petrobras has been winning supporters among the financialcommunity however with record profits last year of rdollars 994bn  thelargest ever by a brazilian

2001by richard cowdenafter opposing a march 2000 proposal to impose 50 percent capital charges onmerchant banking activities several banking organizations now are makingthe case that such charges are unnecessary altogether according to commentletters on a new proposalthe federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currencyjan 22 jointly issued the proposal to establish a rule governing capitalrequirements for merchant banking activities approved by the 1999grammleachbliley actunder the agencies  proposed sliding scale a financial holding companymaking equity investments in nonfinancial companies that account for lessthan 15 percent of its tier i capital would be subject to an 8 percentcapital charge on such investment certain exceptions would includeinvestments made through a small business investment companyan fhc investing between 15 and 25 percent of its tier 1 capital innonfinancial companies would be subject to a 12 percent capital charge andan fhc making such investments accounting for more than 25 percent of itstier 1 capital would be assessed a 25 percent capital charge 15 der a1912301signaling their low expectations that they can fend off a sliding scale ofcapital requirements in the proposal many respondents addressed theirremarks to limiting the eventual rule s impact on existing investmentbanking activities the proposal asked for comments on whether certain kindsof investments made prior to the march 13 2000 the date of the originalproposal should be exempted from the rulewriting for the securities industry association james e reilly chairmanof its holding company committee said his organization continues tobelieve that the agencies should allow firms to rely fully on internalcapital allocation models to control the risks of nonfinancial investmentactivities in the sia s view regulators  concerns about the reliability ofsuch models can be addressed through supervision and examination as iscurrently done in connection with capital allocation for market riskrichard whiting executive director and general counsel of the financialservices roundtable echoed that theme in his comment letter he wrote thatthe january proposal presents an unnecessarily burdensome array ofrestrictions that are neither mandated by safety and soundness nor inkeeping with the language or spirit of the grammleachbliley actwhiting emphasized that the proposed capital requirement was notcontemplated by lawmakers when they enacted the glb act the roundtablebelieves that more than any other provision of the glb act the merchantbanking restrictions in both proposed and final rules have impeded nonbankfirms from becoming fhcs financial holding companies whiting said inevaluating the merchant banking rules it is important to note that neitherthe traditional securities industry nor the venture capital and privateequity investment industries seem to have overcome their aversion to fhcstatus under the glb actthat comment reflected the sentiments of many in the financial servicessector that the capital rules will undercut the benefit of winningpermission for depository institutions to participate in merchant bankingone of the centerpiece provisions of the glb act beth climo executivedirector of the american bankers association securities association wrotein a comment letter that her group remains concerned that any specialcapital charge assessed against fhcs engaged in merchant banking activitieswill further exacerbate the inequities between fhcs and nonfhcs engaged inmerchant banking activitiesfederal regulators have acknowledged the industry s concerns in this regardin his april 4 testimony before two subcommittees of the house committee onfinancial services federal reserve governor laurence h meyer said theproposed capital requirements would be a bridge to an eventual approachthat would use the fhcs  internal modelsreilly wrote sia recommends that if  the agencies determine to adopttheir capital proposal the final rule should contain a  sunset  provisionor at minimum a specific date by which the agencies will formallyreexamine and reevaluate the need for the capital haircutsexemptions for sbicsthe capital proposal would exempt fhc investments in small businessinvestment companies up to 15 percent of tier 1 capital sbics are licensedand regulated by the small business administration and provide equityfinancing longterm credit and technical support to small companiesdespite this special exception the proposed rule would include investmentsin an sbic toward the overall amount that would be considered in determiningthe capital charge level to which the fhc would be subject  groupsrepresenting both large and small financial institutions criticized thisprovision charlotte m bahin director of regulatory affairs and seniorregulatory counsel for america s community bankers wrote imposing highercapital charges on such investment activities by banking organizations maywell have a negative impact on this important source of capitalwhiting wrote if it is concluded that no special capital charge isappropriate for sbic investments we see no reason to conclude that anonsbic investment should have a higher capital charge because there is acertain level of sbic investmentsmany commenters also voiced concerns that under the proposal a series ofother kinds of equity investments that had been authorized before passage ofthe glb act also would count toward the total used in determining whether anfhc exceeded the 15 percent or 25 percent thresholds those investment typeswould include noncontrolling equity investments made under sections 4c6and 4c7 of the bank holding company act portfolio equity investmentsmade under regulation k and most equity investments by statecharteredbanks under section 24 of the federal deposit insurance actgrandfatheredthe proposal would make existing permissible investments such as those insbics subject to the capital charge rule as of march 13 2000 the date ofpublication of the original proposed rule that provision also drew strongcriticism reilly wrote imposing a capital charge on these investmentswithout any evidence that such investments pose a safety and soundness riskwould penalize institutions for engaging in long permissible activities sia respectfully submits that imposing a capital charge retroactively isakin to altering the rules in the middle of the game and doing so couldhave adverse consequencesreilly also suggested that such investments should be grandfathered not onlyfrom the march 2000 date but from the date on which the agencies issue thefinal capital rulemixed activitieswhiting addressed a feature of the proposal that he said could result ininequities for fhcs that invest in companies whose operations involve amixture of activities in some cases the firm in which the investment ismade may engage in activities that are clearly permissible under the bankholding company act because they are incidental and complementary tofinancial activities while there may be questions about the permissibilityof other activities he saidunder the proposed rules if an fhc invested in such a company whitingwrote it would have to do so under its merchant banking authority and mighthave to wait for the federal reserve board to rule on the permissibilityquestion read literally he wrote the special capital charge wouldapply to the entire investment in a company even if its financial andincidental activities represented 99 percent of its total revenues andassets we believe that such a result is illogical and inequitablewhiting suggested this matter could be dealt with by applying the capitalcharge only to the amount of the investment that equals the portion of thecompany s revenues that are not attributable to permissible activitieseuro swap spreads seen sideways us to narrowreuters  april 30 2001by nigel stephensonlondon april 30 reuters  swap spreads have tightened markedly in

has narrowed since the beginning of theyear when the federal reserve embarked on a series of aggressive interestrate cuts to 80 basis points on monday from 104 on december 28swap spreads are going to come in the us because we still have a veryaggressive rate cut priced in said meyrick chapman derivatives analyst atubs warburgeurozone swap spreads also narrowed in january but then moved out andsideways until late march the 10year euro spread narrowed to 43 basispoints on friday close to oneyear lows from 56 on march 22 it stood at44 on mondayin europe the expectation of cuts has brought in swap spreads but we arenot getting any rate cuts right now and that is one of the reasons we mightmove sideways chapman saidhis target was for the 10year dollar swap spread to hit 65 basis points insix months the 10year euro swap spread would narrow to just 38 or 39swap spreads the difference between the swap rate and the government bondyield at any maturity are gaining importance as a measure of bondperformance and of risk appetitea prime driver of the dollar swap spread has been the rapid steepening ofthe yield curve the 210 year treasury spread has steepened to more than100 basis points from 20 at the beginning of this yearchapman said the 210 year spread could widen to 120 having a furtherpositive impact on swap spreadsjim reid credit strategist at barclays capital also said dollar swapspreads could narrow further to the low to mid70s over three monthsspreads held back by emergibg markets equitieshe said that while they were driven inwards by rate cuts they had been heldback by concern over emerging markets and equities which often see creditunderperformif there is any stability in equity markets and any emerging marketspositive news flow you are going to get swap spreads performing indollarshe saw the 10year euro swap spread moving out to 48 or 49 basis points overthree monthswith any lowering of interest rates in the euro zone expected to be modestin comparison with the easing seen in the us analysts said europeancentral bank cuts would not have a major impact on swap spreadsit is already pricing in probably a more aggressive rate cut than you couldpossibly see for the next three months reid saidthe risk reward is definitely for euro swap spreads to widen from herehe addedjose sarafana strategist at westlb in duesseldorf said that after therecent significant narrowing eurozone swap spreads could be ready for acorrectionhe recommended last week that investors consider switching into germangovernment bonds from peripheral eurozone bonds which would underperformas swap spreads widenedhowever longerterm fundamentals supported a further narrowing of spreadshe saw the 10year at 40 by yearendthe economy is slowing governments have to issue more debt than expectedand this should increase the supply so we should see some underperformanceof government bonds versus creditsfurther steepening of the us bond yield curve should see the 10yeardollar swap spread at 65 basis points by yearend sarafana saidfed s greenspan s speech to bond market assnreuters  april 27 2001washington april 27 reuters  the following is a the full text of federalreserve chairman alan greenspan s speech delivered in washington friday onthe paydown of federal debt to the bond market association in white sulfursprings wvai am pleased to be with you this morning and note the bond marketassociation s twentyfifth anniversary over the years i have enjoyed beingassociated with many of you in this audience my very best wishes to heatherruth on the last day of her tenure as president and congratulations to micahgreen upon his appointmenttoday i want to address a subject in which your group and the federalreserve share a keen interestthe paydown of the federal debt and itsimplications for the economy and financial markets while the magnitudes offuture federal unified budget surpluses are uncertain they are highlylikely to remain sizable for some time the dramatic improvement inprojections of the budget balance in recent years reflects in largepart the pickup in underlying productivity growth in the us economywhich has boosted corporate profits and household incomes and thereby taxreceipts in effect we built a tax structure on the assumption that theeconomy would grow over time at rates around those seen from the early 1970sto the mid1990s and this structure has generated considerably more revenueas the economy s underlying growth rate has risen restrainton expenditures also has contributed to the brighter outlooktight limits on spending were imposed in response to the large deficits ofthe 1980s and early 1990s and defense spending was reduced following theend of the cold warboth the office of management and budget and the congressional budget officehave assumed that much of the accelerated productivity growth of the late1990s is likely to be sustained through the next decade no doubt a periodof weakness in measured productivity is likely to accompany the currentslowdown in economic activity however there is little in the recent datato suggest that any significant alterations in these agencies  longertermprojections of structural productivity growth might be requiredshould we infer from these positive budget developments that unified budgetdeficits are no longer conceivable hardly the substantial surpluses inretirement programs especially social security in recent years and in thenearerterm budget projections are on a cash basis were we fully accruingthe benefit liabilities inferable from existing law these retirementprograms would currently be in deficit and contingent liabilities amountingto about 10 trillion for social security alone would have been added to thecurrent debt to the publicwhen the baby boom generation retires and as the population subsequentlyages further these contingent liabilities will come due andbarring anoffsetting surplus in the remainder of the government s budgetwill be metby the issuance of treasury securities shifting much of total federalliabilities from contingent liability to debt to the public atthat point of course the unified budget will be in deficitof more relevance for the nearer term current forecasts suggest that undera reasonably wide variety of possible tax and spending policies theresulting surpluses will allow the treasury debt held by the public to bepaid off moreover well before the debt is eliminatedindeed possiblywithin a relatively few yearsit may become difficult to further reduceoutstanding debt to the public because the remaining obligations will mostlyconsist of savings bonds wellentrenched holdings of longterm marketabledebt and perhaps other types of debt that could prove difficult to reducewhether economic developments and tax and budget choices will in the endproduce surpluses of the order of magnitude currently projected is open todebate but the probability of substantial continuing surpluses issufficiently high to require that at a minimum we begin to address theirpotential implications for fiscal policy decisionmakers financial marketsand the federal reservei have long argued that paying down the national debt is beneficial for theeconomy it keeps interest rates lower than they otherwise would be andfrees savings to finance increases in the capital stock thereby boostingproductivity and real incomes but the current budget projections are suchthat we need to consider what path of debt reduction is best for theeconomy the issue is complicated on the one hand higher national savingby raising the nation s capital stock leaves the country better prepared tocope with the economic effects of the aging of the us populationand oneway to achieve that higher saving is to run budget surpluses on the otherhand after a point this increase in national saving comes at a cost oncetreasury debt reaches itsirreducible minimum additional surpluses will ofnecessity lead to the accumulation of substantial privatethat is to saynonfederalassets either in the treasury s general fund or in governmenttrust fundsthe decisions on how such funds should be invested by the government wouldnecessarily be political ones and would lead to efforts by some groups toobtain via the political process funding that they could not obtain atleast at the same price in private marketsthese efforts would likely result in distortions in the allocation ofcapital that must be balanced against the benefit to the nation of theincrease in saving in fact it is the marketdriven allocation of capitaland labor to their most productive uses that has fostered our recentimpressive gains in productivity and encouraged inflows of capital that haveenabled us to build an extraordinarily efficient capital stock despite quitemodest levels of domestic savingsthe effectiveness of our markets in allocating capital is one of ournation s most valuableassets we need to be careful not to impair their functioning  it isregrettably too easy to envision political pressure being exerted to usegovernment financing of investments to offset perceived capital marketimperfections experience suggests that in such cases the resulting returnsearned on the investments are likely to fall short of market standardsmoreover the social benefits of investment are likely to be very difficultto measure in practice opening the door to political interference in theallocation of fundsit is difficult for example to envision effective constraints being placedon politically attractive investments by definedbenefit trust funds suchas the social security trust fund benefits are guaranteed by governmentirrespective of any losses to the fund thus one must presume that even ifour social security trust funds were to be so seriously impaired bymismanaged government investment that they dried up full benefits would behighly likely to be forthcoming despite the fact that under current law thesocial security trust fund has limited borrowing authority as a resultprospective beneficiaries would have no incentive to police the investmentpolicies of the trust fundto be sure we do have about 3 trillion of assets administered in thedefinedbenefit plans of state and local governments while research in thisarea has been limited it does indicate that state and local pension fundshave tended to underperform private pension funds if required to direct aportion of their investment within the state or to make economicallytargeted investmentssome recent work has suggested that the negative effects of suchrequirements may have been less important in recent years than they were inthe past but that conclusion remainsspeculative along the same lines there is some evidence suggesting thatreturns on state pension funds have been lower where the proportion oftrustees who are political appointees is highersome have argued that methods could be devised to insulate governmentinvestment decisions from the political process even in definedbenefitfunds perhaps by limiting such investments to index funds even if suchmethods were successful the government would be investing only in publiclytraded securities and so its investment might have an adverse effect on therelative financing costs of smaller often quite productivenonpubliclytraded firmsover time these effects would presumably be arbitraged away but such aprocess likely takes time and capital market imperfections in any eventare likely to impede full arbitrage  arguably definedcontribution fundseven if administered by a federal agency could insulate investment policyfrom political interference as well as potentially freeing investment fromthe straightjacket of holding only index funds it is highly unlikely thatthe beneficiaries of such funds would countenance politically convenientinvestments in their retirement funds indeed the 100 billion federallymanaged thriftsavings fund has been operated without such interference i should notehowever that conversion of social security from a defined benefit plan to adefined contribution plan would fundamentally alter its natureone way to employ unified budget surpluses to finance increased investmentwould be to convert such funds into individual retirement accounts owned andadministered by beneficiaries with the presumption that the funds would befully dedicated to retirement in such an instance the resulting reductionin government saving would be offset by a rise in private saving so thattotal domestic saving would be maintained though the availability of newlyowned private assets could reduce the propensity to save out of incomesomewhatgiven concerns about the potential distorting effects of asset accumulationby the treasury or in government definedbenefit plans we need to carefullyconsider the appropriate path of debt paydowns  by addressing this issuenow we can avoid an abrupt and potentially disruptive change in fiscalpolicy as the level of treasury debt reaches its irreducible minimumdespite the clear advantages of paying down the federal debt i recognizethat doing so has some potential adverse consequences even before thedifficulties associated with government accumulation of private assetsarise the treasury market serves a number of useful purposes in additionto providing many of you with profitable employment most obviouslytreasury debt provides an asset that is free of credit risk  acharacteristic that is desirable for many investors especially in times ofeconomic or financial turbulencetreasury yields also provide a benchmark for the quoting and pricing ofrisky debt in addition the size and liquidity of the treasury market allowmarket participants to hedge interest rate risks easily and at low costmoreover the liquidity of these securities enables participants to makerapid adjustments to their portfolios in times of market volatilitythus the elimination of treasury debt does remove something of economicvalue and it will require that significant adjustments be made by marketparticipants indeed with marketable treasury debt held by the publicthatis excluding the federal reserve but including foreign centralbankshaving declined about 20 percent in recent years to less than 25trillion some of these adjustments have already begunreportedly firms have increasingly turned to swaps agency securities andeven larger corporate debt issues to do their hedging after a period oftransition such shifts arguably should not have any significant adverseeffect on risk management as hedging activity moves from the shrinkingtreasury market to alternative markets the liquidity of those marketsshould improve yields on the alternative hedging instruments likely willtrack at least as closely with those on instruments commonly being hedged asdo treasury yieldssimilarly the loss of treasury securities as benchmarks seems unlikely toresult in major difficulties for market participants because alternativebenchmarks are easy to envision for example in european bond marketsswaps are already the most common benchmark even in the united states thetreasury bill market has lost its benchmark status in recent years andhas been replaced in that role by the eurodollar and eurodollar futuresmarkets with no evident adverse effects on the operation of shorttermcredit markets  all of these alternative assets of course involve somedegree of credit risk  however given sufficient demand it seems likely tome that you or your colleagues could produce a nearly riskless securityfor example this could be accomplished with a very senior tranche of acollateralizeddebt obligation backed by highgrade corporate debt  in short i amconfident that us financial markets which are the most innovative andefficient in the world can readily adapt to a paydown of treasury debt bycreating private alternatives with many of the attributes that marketparticipants value in treasury securities of course the resultingadjustments will not be perfect and in some cases will impose costs onfinancial market participants especially during the period of transition tonew products and procedureshowever i believe that these costs are very likely to be outweighed by thebenefits to thecountry of a higher capital stock and the resulting increases inproductivity and income that appear to be the consequence of debt reductionmoreover competitive pressures and profit opportunities will provide astrong incentive for you and your colleagues in the financial industry todevise ways to minimize such costsstill the lack of treasury securities might be a bigger problem forinternational investors than for domestic investors because they may beless well informed about us corporations as a result internationalinvestorsespecially official onesmay have a strong preference for usgovernment instruments in such circumstances foreign investors may reduceon net their holdings of overall dollar assets as treasury securities arepaid down by itself such diminution in the demand for us dollar assetswould tend to raise interest rates for us borrowers and conceivably putdownward pressure on the dollar s exchange ratehowever the evidence of the past year and a half gives little support tothis notion foreign private investors on net have run off their holdingsof us treasury securities while they have built up their holdings ofprivate dollar assets by an even larger amount and the foreign exchangevalue of the dollar has appreciateda final valuable feature of the treasury market is that it is a remarkablyefficient system for funding federal government deficits  becausedemographic and other factors are surely likely to lead to the reemergenceof deficits in the future one might argue that it would be best to continueto borrow at least limited amounts from time to time in order to keep themarket operating so that it will be available when it is needed againwhile that is clearly an alternative we should also keep in mind thatreestablishing the treasury security market likely would not be all thatdifficult borrowing needs in all likelihood would start out small so themarket would have time to developmoreover i have great confidence in your abilityor that of yoursuccessorsto initiate a new market for treasury debt when that becomesnecessary  like other financial market participants the federal reservewill also have to adjust to the loss of treasury debt currently treasurysecurities are the permanent assets that correspond to the currency thatis the federal reserve s main liability treasury securities have severalfeatures that make them particularly attractive assets for the federalreserve first the liquidity of the market allows the federal reserve tomake substantial changes in reserves in a short period of time ifnecessary second the size of the market has meant that the effects of thefederal reserve s purchases on the prices of treasury securities have beenminimal third treasury securities are free of credit risk  thus thefederal reserve does not itself take on such risk when it holds them ishould point out that we do not eschew risk because we fear becominginsolventrather we believe that the effects of federal reserve operations on theallocation of private capital are likely to be minimized when federalreserve intermediation involves primarily the substitution in the public sportfolio of one type of instrument that is free of credit riskcurrencyfor anothertreasury securities as i discussed earlier it isimportant that government holdings of assets not distort the privateallocation of capital and this goal applies to the federal reserve systemas well as to the treasuryhowever if the treasury debt is paid down as i trust it will be then thefederal reserve will have to find alternative assets that still providesubstantial liquidity and minimize distortions to the private allocation ofcapital even before that time the treasury market may become less liquidmaking it more difficult for the fed to make purchases without affectingmarket prices moreover declining treasury debt presumably would at somepoint reduce the liquidity of the treasury repurchase agreement rpmarket  complicating the use of such operations in adjusting the shorttermsupply of reservesin the short run the federal reserve will continue to purchase asubstantial volume of treasury securities in order to minimize the effectsof its purchases on the market however it has established limits on thefraction of individual issues that it will hold going forward the federalopen market committee fomc as you know has also decided on a temporarybasis to allow the open market desk at the federal reserve bank of new yorkto conduct rp operations with agency mortgagebacked securities ascollateral as well as with treasuries and direct agency debtother changes that are already allowed under current statutes could beimplemented to substitute to a limited extent for our holdings of treasurysecurities for example the federal reserve could purchase outrightginnie mae securities which are fully backed by the treasury  it couldalso further broaden the types of collateral allowed for rp operationsperhaps including certain municipal obligations or those of foreigngovernments such an expansion could reduce the effects of federal reserveoperations in the market for any particular type of collateralthe fomc has asked staff to explore all of these shortrun alternativesover a longer time horizon more fundamental changes could be consideredone possibility is to expand the use of the discount window by auctioningsuch credit to financially sound depository institutions such auctionswould enhance our ability to adjust the supply of reserves as needed andbecause these loans would be fully collateralized they would offerconsiderable protection against credit riskanother possibility is to add new assets to those the fed is currentlyallowed by law to buy for its portfolio these assets could be used toprovide a broader range of rp  collateral a process similar in concept tothe expanded use of the discount window as well as ultimately being addedto our permanent portfolio one would hope that such additions would help tolimit the distortions to particular markets caused by federal reservepurchasesof course what adjustments we make to our proceduresand when we makethemdepend on how rapidly the supply of treasury securities dwindles andon how long the treasury market is not available as i noted earlierdemographic forces are likely to cause unified budget deficits to reemergeat some point in the future and fresh supplies of treasury securities to beissued at that time the federal reserve presumably would begin to shiftour portfolio back toward the treasury marketthe timing and extent of the reemergence of treasury issuance will dependon underlying productivity growth and of course on the degree of fiscaldiscipline exercised by future american governments  finally in the periodahead the federal reserve will be seeking active consultations anddiscussions with you and other market participants as well as with thecongress before significant changes are made to federal reserve proceduresand methods while the prospective paydown of treasury debt presents us withchallenges i am confident that with your help the federal reserve canmake the needed adjustments and will be able to continue to implementmonetary policy in the national interestthe benefits of reducing our federal debt make the associated challengeswell worth meetingenron offers structured weather notederivatives week  april 30 2001enron is offering via its internet trading platform a

gauge of personal consumption which accounts for roughly 55 of japan s gdp overnight the yen was supported by the bank of japan s decision to increase its purchases of government bonds to 1 trillion

floundering economy evidenced in the antideflation package released this week that markets for the most part deem ineffectual hayami had clearly indicated his desire that the government would inject

to 115 at the cboe20for investors who want to book a tax loss on beatendown stocks the wash sale rule can be a hurdle because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring substantially identical securities within a 30day period before or after that loss this poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive buy candidates20in addition the internal revenue service has taken the position that the washsale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an inthemoney put because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor20so investors typically get around the washsale rule by doubling up buying additional stock or options waiting at least 31 days and then selling the original stock to book the loss investors double up by buying calls which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stockcopyright  2000 dow

journala3copyright c 2001 dow jones  company inceven as it reiterated its intention to purchase enron corp dynegy inc is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibilliondollar deal20the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energytrading company the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas during the past month enron has taken a 1 billion writeoff of assets revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equitythe problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships run by some of its own executives under investigation by the securities and exchange commission in an sec filing monday enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional writeoffs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 billion in loans by the end of the year20as of 4 pm wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading enron shares fell 198 or 28 to 501 each after having dropped 23 tuesday in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday more than four times the volume of any other big board stock enron s bonds also again traded sharply lower market observers said20the turmoil spilled over to dynegy s stock which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange as of 4 pm wednesday dynegy shares fell 194 to 3976 each20on wednesday dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement though it continued to perform due diligence on enron20under the merger agreement dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron s financial and legal problems become severe enough however some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these socalled material adverse change clauses they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc even though tyson a springdale ark foodproducts company had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit20dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment to complete the deal twothirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval no dates for those votes have been set20one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn t known about dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company s due diligence this person said it couldn t be determined what the new information was20the merger agreement announced nov 9 calls for dynegy to exchange 02685 share for each of enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares giving the purchase a value of about 9 billion at dynegy s current stock price however from a price standpoint the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy20on the day of the merger announcement enron shares were trading at about 863 each or about 83 of the purchase price under the exchange ratio as of wednesday enron s market price was only about 47 of the mergerformula price such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price20sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger initially many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houstonbased dynegy dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger supposed to be completed late next year would significantly and immediately increase dynegy s earnings20now analysts are challenging that assumption ron barone managing director at ubs warburg llc said he believes that because of enron s financial problems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself mr barone said he thinks a likely scenario is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 015 dynegy share for each enron share20such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal according to one person familiar with the merger negotiations dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the nov 9 announcement because of enron s rapidly sinking stock price which at the beginning of this year was above 80 a share20in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street goldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy a longtime enron fan mr fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help dynegy s earnings and whether enron could recover the significant business that has been lost in its giant energytrading operations the enron machine continues to sputter mr fleischer wrote20some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly enron might be pushed into a bankruptcylaw filing without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers an enron bankruptcycourt filing is highly possible said ralph pellecchia a senior director at fitch a creditratings agency on wednesday fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one notch above noninvestmentgrade or junk status but fitch also said it believed enron s trading partners had made significant cash collateral calls in recent days that are well in excess of previous expectations contributing to liquidity pressures20among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of weil gotshal  manges which specializes in bankruptcy and corporateworkout situations asked about a possible bankruptcy filing an enron spokeswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger since the merger announcement enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alternatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them enron said it made some progress improving its financial position the company said it reached a final agreement with units of jp morgan chase  co and citigroup inc on the remaining 450 million of a previously announced 1 billion in secured credit lines enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing 690 million note to middecember from next week the spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn t be required this year2020thaddeus herrick and robin

street journal11232001the wall street journalc1copyright c 2001 dow jones  company incenron corp the embattled houston energy and trading company has been sued by members of its employeeretirement plan which has suffered losses because of enron s plummeting stock price20two separate lawsuits filed in federal court in houston allege enron misled participants in its 401k retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company s shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks the company locked down the retirement plan from oct 17 to nov 19 to make administrative changes which prevented employees from selling enron shares as the share price collapsedenron which recently agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc houston because of mounting financial problems has seen its stock price fall to 501 on wednesday from a peak of nearly 90 a share last year the decline has been costly to participants in enron s retirement plan because more than 60 of the 401k assets were invested in enron shares at the end of last year according to one of the suits20the first suit was filed nov 13 on behalf of plan participants by campbell harrison  wright llp a houston law firm and the second was filed tuesday by seattlebased hagens berman llp both seek classaction certification20enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits a spokeswoman also said the company s 401k plan offers participants 18 investment choices one of which is company stock20the company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive offbalancesheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the company s accounting and enron has said it will restate years of financial information20the suits against enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the companystock portion of their 401k plans the suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price all the suits are pending20as with most of these companies enron matches employee contributions to the 401k with shares of enron stock and also offers enron stock as an investment choice in addition to a variety of mutual funds about 13 billion of the plan s 21 billion in assets was invested in enron shares at the end of 2000 according to the suit filed by campbell harrison20pamela tittle a participant in the 401k plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the enron suit filed by campbell harrison  wright had roughly 2000 shares of enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about 140000 as a result of the stock s decline the suit alleges that the trustees of the enron 401k plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril20the suit filed by hagens berman also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in enron stock in addition it accuses enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the sec20roy e rinard a lineman for enron in oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by hagens berman has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to 70000 from 470000 largely as a result of the decline in enron s stock i feel like i have been betrayed mr rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers i lost my savings my plans for the future everything20under federal pension law companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401k plan until age 5020however plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants which includes choosing prudent investments generally to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary duties employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment this presents a high hurdle so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401k plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities20lynn sarko one of ms tittle s attorneys with seattle s keller rohrback llp is also colead counsel in a similar lawsuit against lucent technologies inc murray hill nj another firm representing ms tittle is dalton gotto samson  kilgard plc which is lead counsel in a similar suit against ikon office solutions inc malvern pa the two law firms are representing ms tittle with campbell harrison  wright20the suits against lucent and ikon like the suit against enron allege that thencurrent plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price representatives for ikon and lucent say their companies didn t require employees to invest in the company stock and educated employees about the need for diversification20the suit in which mr rinard is plaintiff notes that on oct 17 a day after enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling 101 billion in the third quarter enron locked down the 401k plan s assets preventing participants from selling enron shares a lockdown occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another and generally lasts several weeks during which time participants can t make changes in their investment choices20the lockdown was lifted on nov 19 in the interim on nov 8 enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000 by the time the lockdown was lifted as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below 9 a share from 3220 on oct 17 when the lockup started hagens berman attorney karl barth said20they were locked into it right when enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news mr barth said mr rinard s looking at having no retirement savings now it s a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50scopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved 09businessfinancial desk section cfrom sunbeam to enron andersen s reputation suffersby floyd norris11232001the new york timespage 1 column 2c 2001 new york times companythis has been the worst year ever for arthur andersen the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry the securities and exchange commission filed civil fraud complaints against the andersen partner who audited sunbeam and against the firm itself in the waste management case20now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by arthur andersen in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company s reported profits in recent yearsall of which raises the question has arthur andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry20it is not an easy question to answer and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment   if you want to attack andersen for enron you need to know more than we know   arthur levitt the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission said this week20but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases it is materiality in all three cases andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead20materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble the idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong but they can add up20at enron however they did not add up to that much  a total of 93 million over four years the biggest restatement of enron profits concerns a related party that enron now says should have been consolidated it is not clear if andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time20to those who treasure the role of auditors the humiliation of andersen is painful back in the 1950 s it was leonard spacek andersen s managing partner who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it was not showing enough independence his public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job two decades ago when the issue on the table was pension accounting andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules20now andersen s backbone is open to question it was evidence that senior people at andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from waste management that led the sec to bring that suit which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong the partner that the sec says looked the other way at sunbeam is fighting the accusations and andersen says he acted properly20lynn turner who was chief accountant of the sec at the time and is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university says what is happening to andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to coopers  lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits20  we got bludgeoned to death in the press   he said   people did not even want to see us at their doorsteps it was brutal but we deserved it we had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls   by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting20for andersen to avoid that fate its relatively new chief executive joseph berardino who declined to be interviewed for this column will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that mr spacek epitomized and then he will have to convince the public of thatcopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved 09businessfinancial

harrison jr speaks of last year s 31 billion merger of j p morgan and the chase manhattan corporation he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34year career of helping build a giant of the banking business20  this is the first merger i ve been part of   said mr harrison the chief executive of the combined bank   where i feel our core business is complete  the chasej p morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite just as mr harrison intended but with wall street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together the many mergers stock sales and other moneymaking opportunities that were supposed to justify the highpriced acquisition have largely dried up for now20consequently deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that mr harrison 58 may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on wall street20j p morgan chase has won some prominent assignments like handling the revampings of troubled giants like lucent and more recently enron the beleaguered energy trading company20but while j p morgan chase is proud of serving alongside citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to enron on its acquisition by dynegy the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank with enron s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts j p morgan chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with dynegy on track20thanks largely to the slump on wall street j p morgan chase s profits fell by twothirds in the third quarter to 449 million from 14 billion in the period a year ago its stock has dropped 15 percent this year more than other banks  shares the bank s stock is ahead of investment banks like goldman sachs with which j p morgan chase increasingly competes20  the jury is still out in many respects on this merger   said judah kraushaar an analyst at merrill lynch nevertheless he likes j p morgan chase s stock he said because   expectations are very low  20all j p morgan chase s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wall street but some like citigroup are better diversified and have greater involvement in oldfashioned consumer banking which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year20nearly a third of j p morgan chase s revenues are consumeroriented by contrast its chief new york rival citigroup gets half its revenues from consumer businesses20  the timing of the merger was bad   said steven wharton a banking analyst at loomis sayles  company which owns about a million j p morgan chase shares   there s no disputing that  20actually mr harrison disputes it   i can t tell you how happy i am about having done this merger   he said in a recent interview   while there are pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment we have a much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time  20in mr harrison s favor is his battletested team of top executives who have worked together for a decade or more few executives remain in the top spots from the old j p morgan instead most major posts are filled by managers who have worked with mr harrison since his days at chemical bank where he spent most of his career mr harrison s team successfully gobbled up manufacturers hanover bank in 1991 then followed that with chemical s merger with chase manhattan in 1996 before incorporating morgan into the fold last year20the group of chemical veterans includes marc j shapiro who oversees finance and risk management at j p morgan chase donald h layton one of two leaders of investment banking and james b lee jr the bank s senior deal maker the team also includes dina dublon the bank s chief financial officer20two other senior executives have also lived through big deals geoffrey t boisi the other investment banking leader was the onetime investment banking chief at goldman sachs david a coulter in charge of chase s retail bank had been chief executive of bank of america before it was bought by nationsbank20  there aren t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as bill harrison and his team   said mark g solow managing principal at garmark advisors an investment firm and a former senior executive at chemical20still ms dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j p morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations20  in general mergers are very hard on morale   she said   there is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll  20the bank s executives are making the best of a bad situation they have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks  staff or about 2500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced20many of these job cuts were aimed at highcost investment bankers j p morgan chase expects that 6000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year20  we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut   ms dublon said20in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j p morgan chase to overhaul its staff with fewer jobs available on wall street mr shapiro said the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs   people have fewer options   he said   so you have a little more control over the process  20thanks partly to these cuts the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be 36 billion annually compared with an original projection of 2 billion at the time of the merger20the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank s core businesses   what we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company   ms dublon said in a conference call with reporters on oct 17 the day earnings were announced20aside from cost cuts the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the bank s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter but mr harrison points to marketshare gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall street he hopes that when the investment banking business revives j p morgan chase will hold on to these gains20the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas mergers and acquisitions and the underwriting of large investmentgrade bond deals20the bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001 up from chase s 12thplace finish and j p morgan s 10thplace standing during the same period last year according to thomson financial securities data20the merger and acquisitions business which chase had been slowly building for years is stronger following the merger with j p morgan said mr lee a vice chairman at the bank as a result the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old chase only for loans20mr lee remains proud of the bank s work with enron the energy company despite its troubles j p morgan chase along with citigroup raised 1 billion in bank financing for enron earlier this month it was also hired to advise the company which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by dynegy20the old chase long a lending powerhouse would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing but an advisory role would have been less certain mr lee said the investment banker advising enron came from the old j p morgan but with merger activity slow there are few such deals to go around20the bank is also proud of its strength in longterm investmentgrade bonds another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger it moved up to second place in that area so far this year compared with sixth place a year ago20the bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings a surge driven by today s low interest rates in may j p morgan chase raised 12 billion in bonds for worldcom the telecommunications company in the largest corporate debt deal in the united states on record20unfortunately for j p morgan chase the fees for underwriting investmentgrade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock where j p morgan chase remains a secondtier competitor20the bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock falling to 9th place this year compared with the old j p morgan s 6thplace finish a year ago chase was 11th20mr harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business   we think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five   he said20given the slowdown some bankers predict that mr harrison will ultimately do another deal either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking like the equity division20  the general view is that the combination with j p morgan didn t do enough   one investment banker said20mr harrison disagrees   i don t feel   he said   we need to do another large deal to be successful  photo william b harrison jr the chief executive says he has no doubts about the wisdom of forming j p morgan chase even though the the economy has slowed since then   i can t tell you how happy i am about having done this merger   he said associated press chart   still looking for the right mix   when j p morgan and chase announced their merger in september 2000 the combination s strength in investment banking seemed sure to be successful but the bank s stock has

together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001then came the california power crisis and allegations of pricegouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group that was followed by renewed volatility in power prices and this time the prices were headed down not up20and then came a crushing blow against trading firms  the unraveling of the industry s

fault of marktomarket accounting issues there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create20answers elude investors20investors are asking hard questions and not always getting the answers they want20using marktomarket methods a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position  whether it s a contract an option a swap etc  at the time even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period the problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment also sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position this is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn t liquid20over time companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their marktomarket gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure said abn amro inc analyst paul patterson20encouragingly it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure according to a survey patterson conducted more

investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce20tim o brien portfolio manager of the gabelli utilities fund said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies still the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices20energy merchants include companies such as dynegy inc dyn duke energy corp duk and dominion resources inc d20according to o brien the group never deserved to have the pricetoearnings multiples above 20 to 30times earnings which were once paid for the stocks20we all got sucked up by the upleg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are o brien said adding that the average multiple should be in the high singledigits to the highteens20as for independent power producers  which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market  the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio according to o brien20one analogy is that they are basically like commercial realestate plays o brien said20that could mean stocks such as calpine corp cpn which is already in the

to the matter it is also exploring the idea of alliances with other exchanges and considering developing emini contracts  smaller energy contracts for internetbased trade by retail investors20there s new management in place at the exchange said nymex spokeswoman nachamah jacobovits they re rethinking all of our business strategies and one very massive strategy was the idea of this major enymex b2b businesstobusiness system launch with a whole new slate of products20nymex and globalview software inc a company that initially worked on building the enymex trading system have sued each other in a dispute over work on the project20kiodex an electronictrading technology firm that has developed the back end of the enymex system took on added development work for the project after globalview departed the trade engine kiodex was asked to build is substantially complete but the company can t speak to nymex s overall electronictrading strategy a kiodex source said20the enymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading overthecounter energy products but nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading some of them on access initially an overnight trading system that was expanded in september it hopes for example to launch gas swaps based on delivery at the henry hub within the next six weeks on access jacobovits said20we ve expedited plans for a henry hub natural gas swap contract jacobovits said traders could be looking for otc clearing on a neutralbased platform which is a factor in that decision20before sept 14 access was used only to trade energy futures at night after the day s nymex session had ended use was limited to nymex members with dedicated phone systems20the exchange had been planning to expand use of access but ended up doing so sooner than it had expected on sept 14 it started offering access trading over the internet a move that will eventually allow nymex to open up trade to more users20the move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the sept 11 attack on the world trade center nymex s building located near where the trade towers stood was shut down for several days after the attacks expanding its already existent access system to the internet helped ease potential liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading hours after nymex reopened20development of the enymex system began last year under the direction of former nymex chairman daniel rappaport in august nymex said it would launch the enymex platform within four to eight months new nymex president j robert bo collins jr said then that vendor problems had slowed development of the system s frontend technology and caused the delays but he still expected enymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original product line20if nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as enymex with access the new system may end up being known as enymex20enymex right now is looking for a new mission said an industry source close to nymex you know how politics works we don t scrap it we just rename it anything we do electronically is now going to be called enymex but the original deal and concept that rappaport initiated is done20nymex s reconsideration comes as the energytrading world undergoes rapid change the two most successful online energy trading platforms  enron corp s ene enrononline and intercontinentalexchange or ice  have seen their luck turn  in opposite directions20enron corp ene which accounts for about 25 of the trade in us power and gas markets faces questions about its creditworthiness as the securities and exchange commission investigates complicated financial dealings enron s possible merger with dynegy inc dyn now appears to be in doubt and energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company20enron executes about 60 of its power and gas trades on enrononline when enron s troubles surfaced last month nymex quickly moved to extend its clearing services to overthecounter natural gas derivatives a move the trading community saw as an attempt to grab market share20ice on the other hand is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy trade on its electronic format ice closed a deal this summer to acquire the londonbased international petroleum exchange  nymex s chief competitor and europe s largest traditional energy exchange it plans to move all ipe energy contracts to its internetbased system and offer clearing services for some overthecounter contracts20nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new competitive landscape one idea under review is a joint venture with the chicago mercantile exchange to offer emini contracts for nymex products on cme s globex electronictrading system the person close to nymex said20nymex officials wouldn t confirm whether they re talking with the cme but they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one20nymex is always open to strategic alliances jacobovits said there s nothing we ve agreed to at this point but we have open dialogue with a number of exchanges concerning strategic alliances we have a good relationship with the chicago merc and we certainly would be open to working with them20shortly after the sept 11 terrorist attacks in new york shut down the nymex trading floor the cme said it would be willing to offer nymex

demand holds load factors high despite alliancethe introduction of the 1325 bcfd alliance pipeline into the north american gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western canada than expected according to representatives of transcanada pipelines pge gas transmission and alliance extremely strong gas demand in the pacific northwest california and in the midwest has produced continued high load factors on transcanada and pge gtnw despite the presence of their huge new rival for western canadian supply the contract picture changed significantly on transcanada since the first of november and primarily at our empress ab delivery point into the transcanada mainline from the alberta pipe but actual physical gas flows at about 6 bcfd have not changed correspondingly said klaus exner director of pipeline system operations at transcanada the big picture overview that i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta through british columbia and into the pge systems that hasn t let up at all and we don t foresee that letting up pge gas transmission spokeswoman sandra mcdonough said pge gtnw has been running full at 26 bcfd for some time and is delivering 900 mmcfd to noncalifornia load in the pacific northwest we re turning back demand right now every power plant in this region is running full tilt tuscarora gas transmission the nevada pipeline is full our northwest deliveries are fixed we re delivering as much as we can deliver right now transcanada s other major export route out of the western canadian sedimentary basin is the foothills and northern border route into the midwest it also continues to operate at high load factors we didn t see a huge dropoff in physical flows post nov 1 we ve seen the it volumes come up considerably said exner the one thing that has changed is the volatility of the flows customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and we re seeing more up and down and daytoday variations according to the weather and the markets than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level the fluctuations are driven purely by the price differential between aeco and the dawn hub in ontario which indicates whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not alliance pipeline spokesman jack crawford said the system has been running flat out at about 1325 bcfd since the valves were opened for commercial service dec 1 he also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas flows to 15 bcfd with existing compression the additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers crawford said we haven t cranked up the system above the contract capacity yet we probably won t do that for a couple weeks until we get things ironed out frankly though i m not sure chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the pacific northwest and california

cheryl@flex.net,mike.mcconnell@enron.com|mmccontex.@aol.com,february 27 2001via faxmr alan kentflair construction co incre proposed unimproved property contract by and between flair constructionco inc as seller and mike  chris mcconnell as buyerdear mr kentwe have read and reviewed the above referenced contract  on behalf of mr mrs mcconnell we would like to make the following comments and suggestionsgenerally our major concern is what happens if in the unlikely event mr mrs mcconnell cannot reach an agreement with you regarding the constructionof their home  the homesite reservation agreement states that they mustsell the lots back to you as the developer at seventy five percent 75 ofthe sales price if you as the builder do not start construction within six6 months of the date the lots were purchased  in such an event mr mrs mcconnell would lose a substantial amount of money  therefore wewould like to know if you have any suggestions as to how to address thisproblemwe make the following specific comments regarding the unimproved propertycontract itself in chronological order1 paragraph 2 property  as we discussed we would like to get a copy ofthe deed restrictions as soon as possible so as to make sure that mrmcconnell s house will not be atypical for this subdivision2 paragraph 5 earnest money  we suggest that the earnest money be paid tothe title company3 paragraph 6 title policy  survey atitle policy 6  in view of thefact that the lakes at sterling gate is a new subdivision we have suggestedto mr  mrs mcconnell that they request that the exception as todiscrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachmentsor protrusions or overlapping improvements be deleted from their ownerspolicy of title insurance  we understand that mr  mrs mcconnell willhave to pay the additional cost for this exception to be deleted  howeverbefore the title company will delete this exception it is necessary that asurvey of the lots being purchased be provided to the title company  do youhave or can you provide such a survey4 paragraph 6 title policy  survey notice to seller and buyer 6  weask that this paragraph relating to your right to continue to show theproperty for sale be deleted5 paragraph 7 property condition b  we suggested to mr  mrsmcconnell that subparagraph one 1 be checked rather than subparagraph two2 reflecting that the buyers are accepting the property in its presentcondition  mr  mrs mcconnell intend on hiring an inspector and wethought it may be a good idea for the inspector to have an opportunity toinspect the property itself before construction  therefore we ask that asmall option fee be put in to this paragraph and that mr  mrs mcconnell sinspector has thirty 30 days to check out the property accordingly6 paragraph 8 brokers fees  it is our understanding that mr larrywilliams of prudential gary greene realtors represents flair constructiontherefore we would ask for an affirmative statement that any brokers  feesbe paid by flair accordingly7 paragraph 11 special provisions  it is written in that the closing onthese lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on march 1 2001 whichever is later  however we do not know what roads are being addressed andthink that this sentence needs far more specificity  the second sentenceregarding mr  mrs mcconnell s obligation to use flair homes has alreadybeen addressed  the third sentence regarding when construction must startshould be revised to give mr  mrs mcconnell more time to hire anarchitect etc  we would suggest one hundred and eighty 180 days  alsoonce mr  mrs mcconnell notify you that they are ready for construction webelieve you should be under an obligation to start construction thirty 30days thereafter8 paragraph 13 rollback taxes  as you know if there was every anagricultural timber or other exemption on this property this paragraphstates that any rollback taxes will be paid by mr  mrs mcconnell  wewant to make absolutely certain that no such exemptions exist  thereforeif you could ask that title company to provide a tax certificate showingthat no exemptions exist before closing we would appreciate it  if thereever were such exemptions we need to be made aware of that as soon aspossible9 paragraph 18 escrow  as we indicated earlier we believe the earnestmoney should be paid to the title company  since the earnest money is inexcess of 5000000 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertainwe believe the title company should be asked to deposit the earnest money inan interest bearing account and that mr  mrs mcconnell should receive acredit accordinglywe would appreciate it if you could respond to each of our suggestions andcomments in this letter as soon as possible  we know mr  mrs mcconnellare very much looking forward to working with you in connection withconstruction of their homevery truly yoursdonald s stirmandsscsbcc mr  mrs mike mcconnell via email

wanda.curry@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff i have looked at your fax  this is a tough one due to conflicting agendas  if we are actually paid the px credits or the remaining cumulative unpaid credit balances sce may be correct eg if an esp s purchased wholesale energy at the px credit rate or lower  than their total cost of energy supply is the same or less than that of a bundled customer  the impact on the tra account should have been the same regardless of customer type but only if they can prove the px credit actually equals their purchase cost  this may reopen the audit issue  how does anyone really know that sce did not enter into purchase contracts at other than px  market rates   if they did they credits should be in this account as well as you know  we have not been paid these px amounts  i probably do not have enough history re the tra accounting to give you a good defense against their argument other than a  nonby passable charge should not apply if the credit is not paidone other thought shouldn t the amount of unrecovered tra also be born by the utility of course it would help if they were not almost bankrupt  the intent all along is the utilities were given a set period of time to recover this amount and once the time elapsed tough luck  how does this play into this  should they be kept whole if they were not able to execute this plan  thankswanda original messagefrom  dasovich jeff  sent wednesday september  26 2001 623 pmto tribolet michael curry wandasubject edison s argument regarding px crediti d like to fax you something that edison sent in support of their argument that1 by virture of the px credit framework da customers contributed to edison s undercollection and2 da customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollectioncould i get your fax numbers  would like to get your comments once you ve reviewed the argument  thanksbestjeff

metro deskelectricity cost data spread the blame power many suppliers charged more than the firms that davis has pilloried records showrich connell robert j lopez doug smithtimes staff writers07102001los angeles timeshome editionb1copyright 2001  the times mirror companysacramento  california s energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by gov gray davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of texas companies state records show during the first three months of this yearone of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisisan assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms according to documents released to the times on monday by the department of water resources which now buys power for californiaamong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a canadian public utility a subsidiary of san diego gas  electric s parent company and the los angeles department of water and power the report shows their average prices ranged from 498 a megawatthour charged by powerex the trading arm of british columbia s bc hydro to 292 an hour by the dwp in fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by davis and other state officialsdynegy inc duke energy and mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period those companies  average prices ranged from 146 to 240 per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents the figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period you have to look at the whole picture maviglio said the governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said their profits were 100 to 400 above last year    just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesn t change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston tulsa atlanta or charlotte the report by the department of water resources was provided to the times on the same day the state released 1700 pages of documents on california s electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year s first quarter the records detail how the state spent nearly 8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the state s energy problem they also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year all the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midjanuary the average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from 316 in january to 243 in may spot prices fell from an average of 321 per hour to 271 the reports show in the first quarter of the year some public entities  prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies for example houstonbased enron one of the nation s biggest power traders charged an average of 181 per megawatthour and atlantabased mirant which sold the most to the state a total of 706 million charged an average of 225 per megawatthour by contrast a calgary canada firm transalta energy averaged 335 a megawatthour and the sacramento municipal utility district had average charges of 330 per megawatthour a spokesman for enron mark palmer said recently that the vilification of enron was based on politics not facts spokesmen for bc hydro could not be reached late monday to comment on its huge sales to the state in the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep california s lights on a spokeswoman for sempra the parent company of san diego gas  electric said late monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state officials at dwp who could not be reached monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high more power bought than projected hidalgo of the department of water resources said his agency s efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the state s market still the state had to purchase 321 million in power in april and may about 10 more than davis  analysts had projected hidlago said that was because of hot weather in may and other supply problems in april he said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in june and early july the reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in june and july partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under 100 a megawatthour a summary department of water resources report released monday credited davis  program of nurturing new power generation and establishing longterm power contracts with with moving the california electric energy industry closer to normalcycopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved

utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb 7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires but it postponed action on another pge request that southern california gas co  which has strongly objected  be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pge utility s residential and small business customers loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said pge s utility is a victim  a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front  not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness the cpuc action allows pge s utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utility s retail customers  bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pge s gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious it won t be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to pge gas utility spokesperson staci homrig on the operational side pge on wednesday declared a lowinventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system the action was thought to help cause the pge citygate price to jump from 11 to 17 on wednesday as for reports of low storage homrig said that while the utility s supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point homrig said lynch said that pge has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh lynch said in voting for the securitization measure suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements  pay us today  they are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pge amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing part of the cpuc s action places a 90day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another 30 days  worth of supplies said homrig who noted that almost all of pge s 25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid on the gas side pge has had sufficient revenues  unlike its electric business  but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities a key piece was missing however california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business a spokesman for the assembly speaker s office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled one piece of legislation that got through the state senate sb 1x yesterday authorizes another 500 million in emergency funds to purchase power it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities  wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through 2002 the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible the bill which was first passed by the state assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities this prompted at least one of the utilities southern california edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company a letter surfaced in washington from gov gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee dated jan 30 and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state s public utilities the letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional 2000 mw would be online by the end of the year responding to questions on another arena edison international s senior vice president tom higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between davis  threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities  own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections the state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the california independent grid operator caliso urged conservation because reserves remain very low

governor has control of the billwhich means that neither the democratic nor republican leadership want tomove the bill  as a result they are deferring to the cpuc to address theqf issues  the cpuc is expected to release a decision on thursday whichwill be a revised wood pd  while not having a lot of detail on what the pdmay say it is expected that the price cap will be lifted in some mannerwhile it is difficult to ascribe specifically why the bill has been waylaidit is clear that 1 sce has been effective in arguing that the qfs are notin the box established by mr keeley ie 78 centskwh 2 the initialkeeley box has been replaced by the governor s box which is in some senserelated to the price dwr has been paying for its purchases and as a resultthe qf box may be perceived by the governor as less than 78 centskwh3 the democrats and even the republican leadership were reluctant totackle a complicated rate setting bill and assume the risk of gettingburned as occurred in ab1890 and they were reluctant to take the lead onlegislating a fiveyear deal 4 the governor has consistently wanted theqf bill to be tied to the mega bill and this seems to be occurring throughthe lack of action 5 in the absence of some compelling crises egwholesale shutdowns the legislature failed to see the urgency to move thebill at this timenext stepsat this point we will await the pd  it is unlikely that the pd will beable to simultaneously 1 address srac within the box as directed by thegovernor and 2 be consistent with state section 390 and federal purpalaw particularly given the paucity of a record at the cpuc on which tobase its decisionupon receiving and reviewing the pd we will convene a conference call ofthe iep qfrenewable committee to discuss next steps

enronby elizabeth r smith04012001the new york timespage 13 column 1c 2001 new york times companycalifornia s rolling blackouts and a looming energy crisis in other parts of the country are stoking investor interest in companies positioned to reap benefits from the power shortages many investors stunned by the market s precipitous fall see energy as one of the few sectors with a promising profit outlookand in that socalled energy merchant sector the enron corporation stands out as the industry leader based in houston it buys and sells wholesale electricity natural gas and scores of other commodities including broadband capacity for datadelivery services in the fourth quarter of 2000 enron s revenue more than tripled to 4075 billion from the period a year earlier that mushrooming revenue can be traced to the unprecedented surge in the price of electricity and natural gas particularly in california on tuesday california power regulators approved a 46 percent increase in electricity rates the largest in the state s history electricity shortfalls have also been predicted for new york city this summer despite its redhot market enron is no bargain its share price surged 87 percent in 2000 to end the year at 83125 up from 44375 a year earlier it hit a 12month intraday high of 9075 on aug 23 around the time that california s utilities first sounded the alarm and even though enron has taken some hits this year the stock closed at 5810 on friday 395 times its 2001 earnings per share well above its peers on march 22 it fell to a 12month low of 5151 amid concerns about possible layoffs in its broadband operations but rebounded after jeffrey k skilling the chief executive assured investors that all was well in broadband enron s edge is its sheer size and its recognized competence in helping corporate clients cope with unprecedented swings in electricity prices enron in turn charges a premium to manage the risk of energy price movements said donato j eassey a naturalgas analyst at merrill lynch   they have market intelligence that is second to none   he said   they help firms lower the cost by avoiding the spot market for power   the value of enron s broadband effort and its core wholesale energy operations have yet to be fully reflected in its stock price he added predicting that shares will climb to 9920 in 12 months raymond c niles an analyst at salomon smith barney also likes enron because of its dominance the company has unit operating margins that are two to three times that of its closest competitor dynegy in wholesale energy he said   when the heat is on literally people need a company like enron for physical delivery because it has so many ways to get them that resource   he predicted that the stock would rise to 100 within 12 months neither analyst is worried about developments in india where enron was forced to invoke government guarantees to recoup payment for power generated at its dabhol power plant in the state of maharashtra other experts favor enron because it is not just a pure power play the company which is shedding many of its hard assets has bet heavily on its prospects for buying and selling broadband capacity skeptics say the demand for broadband is nowhere near as immediate as the need for energy but amy m jaffe a senior energy adviser at the james a baker iii institute for public policy at rice university in houston said enron was smart to move into broadband   they might be in broadband too early but that s ok she said   there will be demand for it   enron s expansion into data delivery as well as its marketmaking of energy commodities help distinguish it from classic energy businesses like oil companies she said lawrence r fuller a senior portfolio manager at the merrill lynch fundamental growth fund says enron is his largest energy holding   the company is controversial because its valuation is very high   mr fuller said   but they have a tremendous lead over their rivals and a mastery of their business you have tremendous economies of scale here that drive their profit  copyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved outlookeditorialspull the plug  not enough sunshine on politics of water boardstaff04012001houston chronicle4 star2copyright 2001the time has come to pull the plug on the houston area water corp the citizen board called the hawk that is in the process of recommending a company to design build and operate a water plant at lake houston the members of the hawk board appear to have done their job thoroughly and conscientiously the board s chairman attorney david berg has been commendably outspoken about his concerns for the bidding process and the wherewithal of azurix corp a troubled affiliate of energy giant enron corp and one of three companies in the final running for the contracthowever the political maneuverings and pressures being placed behind the scenes on both city staff evaluating the bid proposals and the hawk board bear much more scrutiny than can be gained in the format of this quasiprivate corporation city attorney anthony hall reported the chronicle s mary flood started an hourlong heated argument with berg at a march 21 mayoral fundraiser over the possibility that azurix rumored as the favorite of mayor lee brown s administration might not win the bid sources familiar with the argument told flood that hall threatened berg that he would dismantle the hawk if the process that kept azurix as the winning recommendation was not followed hall denied he said anything like that saying his complaints were about procedures berg would not comment specifically on that matter hall according to flood s report said he told berg that because the companies had relied on a longestablished formula for choosing the frontrunner it would invite trouble to change or ignore the formula now but the companies said they were never told about the formula and have had nothing specific to rely on about how the staff or the hawk board would make its decision the pressure brought to bear on the hawk in such an unsavory way and without public controls is extremely troubling these boards clearly were never intended to handle projects so politically divisive with so much money at stake the water plant contract under bid is worth 150 million the water project it is part of could reach 2 billion state rep garnet coleman dhouston who wrote the statute allowing local government corporations such as hawk said he never intended these citizen boards to handle projects as large as the water plant politicians who want to guide this process ought to be willing to do it openly and face both the public scrutiny and the consequences of their actions for that reason  not because the bid award may not go the way the city administration wants it to  the hawk corporation should be dissolvedcopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved usa exxon mobil tops

cunning in blackedout deregulated january after the briefest of gilded ages we found that california really is an island on the land just as its most perceptive observers had said it was and that california s energy resources are as fragile and limited as any island swe would have been better served if in our haste we had paused to read two timely books on the history of power and its regulation while they do not foreshadow california s current electrical mess they throw some historical light on why we re in the dark in the natural gas market sixty years of regulation and deregulation by paul w macavoy the problem is the inadequacy of the regulatory models that states and federal agencies have applied to natural gas production and distribution since the 1930s none macavoy says made natural gas plentiful cheap and profitable all at the same time and no oneproducers pipeline operators retailers or consumershas benefited from the failed attempts the current natural gas shortage driving up household bills and the operating costs of california s gasfueled electricity plants is the result macavoy would argue of regulatory approaches that can t work macavoy believes a rational market could be made for natural gas through complete deregulation except for the irrationality of consumers they don t see natural gas as a substanceless commodity to be priced and delivered by the workings of the market forces that interest macavoy a professor at yale s school of management consumers see gasand electricityas something real like sunlight or air that flows predictably from a second nature of pipelines and transmission towers the presence in the landscape of these gridslike the grids of aqueducts and highwaysis so necessary and expected that ordinary nature is unimaginable without them californians have superimposed a manmade second nature of energy production and distribution on the state s unforgiving landscapes too but our unique problem is a gold rush mythology of abundance limitless power is part of the myth beginning with the belief in the 1860s and 1870s that california s hills having yielded gold for the taking would yield coal just as abundantly to power the state s transition to an industrial economy california had plenty of gold it turned out but almost no coal nor could the state produce enough firewood where people needed it or kerosene to fuel its lamps or manpower to till its fields wood coal kerosene and labor were power crises in the 19th century that were ultimately resolved by technical innovation resource substitution and historically higher energy costs for california consumers in the 20th century new believers preached that the sierra nevada foothills would flow with endless hydropower to keep city lights shining that more oil fields were ready to be discovered to fuel the state s power plants and that nuclear technology would make electricity too cheap to meter it hardly mattered that there was no foundation for these beliefs either our resilient faith in a second nature of power that is adequate to the myth of california gives james c williams  energy and the making of modern california its poignancy williams whose book was published in hardcover in 1997 does not forecast the deregulation crisis of 2001 but he might have speaking of americans generally williams says they have believed each new energy resource to be without fault to be infinitely abundant and therefore to have the potential to effect utopian societal change moreover people s faith in an energy resource seems to persist until  its shortcomings are obvious and only then do they see it cannot bring utopia yet the failure of a resource to live up to their expectations has not seemed to dampen their enthusiasm as they simply transfer the myth from a fallen energy resource to the next resource appropriated for use in 1996 the california legislature simply substituted a deregulated electricity marketplace as the next energy resource expected to work on utopian principles williams ends his account of california s energy history at the hopeful moment in the late 1980s when a diversified innovative and less centralized energy paradigm seemed ascendant although not as radical as environmental purists wanted he says california s emphasis on energy conservation and alternative power sourcessolar geothermal wind and biomass among themdefined a more benign and flexible soft energy path paralleling the hard energy path of gasfired steam generators nuclear plants and hydroelectric dams between 1973 and 1988 williams reports california s population grew 37 and its economy as measured in goods and services grew 46 while the state s energy consumption grew only 8 in part because of some of the strictest standards in the world for building insulation and appliance efficiency jerry brown california governor from 1974 through 1982 was right after all weatherstripping and windmills do make a difference brown s career needs no rehabilitation now as he begins his campaign for a second term as mayor of oakland but the debacle of electrical deregulation is set to consume other political futures when electricity bills jump 40 in may to a projected 100 by the end of summer sen steve peace del cajon and public utilities commission president loretta lynch will take the fall gov gray davis probably will too the blame for the state s slide into deregulated chaos goes well beyond today s cast of bewildered politicians but californians are unlikely to round up all the suspectsourselves includedwho might be made to answer for it we were too distracted by the collapse of the state s old economy in 1990 the la riots earthquakes and other disasters to attend to the tedium of energy policy no one seemed to notice how electricity deregulation launched without much meaningful debate in 1996 recycled the myth of energy abundance that williams lucidly details decade by decade beginning in 1850 or that deregulation required a rapid and sustained increase in generating capacity if it was going to deliver the substantially lower electricity costs promised for 2001 that was wishful thinking long before the legislature s unanimous deregulation vote in 1994 john bryson chief executive of southern california edison told the california public utilities commission edison does not need any additional power until at least 2005 bryson s declaration that california faced an energy glutnot a shortagewas in response to a controversial decision by the puc ordering the state s major utilities to purchase 1400 megawatts of new power annually beginning in 1998 the puc order was driven by a 1992 california energy commission forecast fairly accurate it turns out that californians would need 55819 megawatts of electricity in 2000 the actual usage was closer to 54000 megawatts to foster competitors to the state s largest utilitiespacific gas  electric edison and san diego gas  electricthe puc order also required them to buy all this new power from independent suppliers whose presence in california s limited energy market would the puc believed not only deliver the required megawatts but also gradually cut consumer electric bills in addition the puc ordered the three utilities to buy part of this new power from suppliers using alternative and renewable energy sourceswindmills geothermal and solar continuing california s successful experiment in a parallel industry of soft energy supply the utilities resisted with deregulation the goal of the clinton administration as much as of the power industry the puc s order to buy more electricityand expand the smallisbeautiful supply model that williams believed was possible in 1997 when his book was publishedlooked to the utilities like the subsidization of future competitors in 1995 edison and sdge convinced the federal energy regulatory commission that giving environmentally friendly generators preferential treatment was illegal and that california in the midst of a businesscrunching recession didn t need more power anyway under pressure from the federal commission the puc caved in and edison and sdge got exactly what they wantedrelief from new competition continued centralization of production within the traditional utility grid and a puc committed to demolishing the state s 80yearold system of utility regulation the puc even discouraged the utilities from signing longterm supply contracts at current prices because the puc professed to believe that deregulation would generate lower energy prices more quickly than anyone expected to show stockholders that they were no longer the dowdy power companies of the old economy the utilities sweetened shortterm profits by refusing to invest in plant construction spun off revenues from their pucregulated divisions into stock buybacks and worked very hard for full deregulation their victory a year later was a catastrophe the deregulation consumers gotin the ironic words of state sen jim brulte rrancho cucamonga one of the most farreaching and forwardthinking pieces of legislation in california historywas peculiarly californian in its degree of institutional amnesia as political cover for legislators who feared prices would immediately climb the deregulation bill cut electricity rates 10 and froze increases until march 2002 that gave residential consumers and businesses no reason to switch to alternative power sources or conserve more the bill satisfied the interests of consumer advocates because it promised to break the utilities  threeway monopoly on electricity production and shrink the power of the puc seen as too friendly for too long with the power companies it was supposed to regulate deregulation however continued to shield profits at edison pge and sdge by guaranteeing them 26 billion in revenue to cover their massive debt for nuclear power plant construction deregulation also pleased environmentalists because they thought it would take the state further down the soft energy path the deregulation bill encouraged the utilities to sell off their existing fossilfueled generators but it failed to offer enough incentives for the construction of environmentally friendly ones despite the 12year gap since the construction of the last major power plant anywhere in california finally deregulation created a power market so fragmented that it was ludicrously easy to manipulate when the thin surplus of power supply in the west began evaporating in the summer of 2000 although the evidence is masked by the effects of a drought in the northwest which has reduced hydropower and an unlucky combination of plant maintenance air pollution limits idling older plants and higher than expected costs for natural gas the price of bad luck bad weather and the cunning of power suppliers was staggering at one point in december electricity that cost 250 a megawatthour to produce was priced by the power brokers of the california independent system operator at 1500 a megawatthour that was the negotiated price the suppliers had asked for 2000 deregulation had set up a divided marketplace more irrational than any paul w macavoy picks apart in his analysis of natural gas in which the california power exchange was a clearinghouse where buyers and sellers set the price of electricity and the california independent system operator was the buyer of last resort if occasional gaps between production and distribution unexpectedly failed to meet daily demand the arrangement began unraveling in mid1998 and the power exchange effectively collapsed as soon as sdge became fully deregulated in july 2000 leaving the poorly trained bureaucrats of the caliso in december and january to struggle to buy 30 of the state s daily power needs at arbitrary prices they passed on to utility company managers the spectacle of the caliso gratefully paying a 500 premium over the cost of production to keep the lights on last winter was a lesson in market fundamentalism with a vengeance californians tutored by earnest neoconservatives such as peace believed that a deregulated market would generate abundant lowcost power simply because that s what a market freed of regulation would do despite the evidence that this particular market was based on false assumptions and likely to be manipulated by the energy suppliers who designed it in an empty contest of metaphors in 1994 and 1995 the dead hand of state regulation had lost to the invisible hand of the marketplace we ll never know if gradual expansion of competition within the framework of regulation would have made california s power system more flexible and environmentally sustainable and less costly to consumers as williams suggested it might  power tends to corrupt lord acton said he didn t mean that the powerful are necessarily brutal or cruel he was criticizing the blinding power that flows from unexamined convictions and he was writing about the papacy of pope pius ix who forced the doctrine of papal infallibility on the catholic church the makers of deregulationstate legislators consumer advocates puc commissioners and environmentalistswere convinced that the market they constructed was infallible too that belief led them to pursue their own selfinterest in the long run consumers can expect deregulation s perverse effects to include significantly higher electricity bills as we pay off 30 billion in new debt diminished local authority over power plant construction and further disarray among the smallscale producers of renewable energy the failure of deregulation also will recast the way power is distributed in california as the state hesitantly moves to control part of the electrical grid in exchange for bonding the utilities  debt this first step in creating a state power authority is being resisted by power suppliers who rightly fear that public anger over mismanagement of the power system has hardened into sympathy for public ownership as it almost did in the early 1920s in the short run the failure of deregulation will determine if california s hopeful new economy plays out as something more than the latest of the state s many booms there were extractive onesgold cattle wheat oil suburban house lots and military hardware and there were booms that wove mythshealthseeking in the sunshine tourism the movies and all the lost dotcoms of last year apart from the good and the bad they ve done our state our booms have reflected the belief bordering on religious faith that what is true about california today will be true permanently california s utopian expectations about energy whose history williams diligently surveys are central to that myth it sustained our optimism about california s ability to power itself in the past it s fueling our pessimism today as we lead ourselves deeper into the darkphoto  nevada transmission line tower at night by john sexton from places of

of ias officersour special correspondent03312001the hinducopyright c 2001 kasturi  sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm  asia intelligence wirebangalore march 30 the chief minister mr sm krishna today spoke out strongly against the dumping of ias officers on the state and said a stage would soon be reached when karnataka would have to reject such postings he was replying to the discussion on the budget estimates for 20012002 in the legislative council the house later passed the appropriation bill moved by the chief minister who also holds the finance portfoliomr krishna who received a round of applause for his stance against the large number of ias and ips officers in the state said the strength of the ias officers was swelling it is only karnataka which is getting a large number of officers from the other states while it is not the case in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu the chief minister said it was not his desire to question the competence of ias officers from outside the state but then i have to be proud of my own people even the few people who pass the central services examination from the state are not posted here a karnataka girl who passed the ias last year was posted to the northeast despite her request to be posted in her home state mr krishna reacting to a suggestion by some of the legislators that the house adopt a resolution on this matter said he would rather bring the matter to the notice of the union home minister the centre should rethink on this matter there was also the need for karnataka to have a share of the top posts at the central level i am only expressing the feelings of the people in public administration the centre should focus its attention on this matter referring to the power sector reforms and the union government selecting the state as one of the first beneficiaries the chief minister said the transmission and distribution losses in the state were 38 per cent while the national average was around 40 per cent karnataka could not be an exception from what was happening in the other parts of the country although efforts were now being made to improve the grid situation and ensure metering of all electrical installations which was the key to checking power theft he said it was a blessing in disguise that the state had dropped the 1000 mw cogentrix power project in mangalore otherwise the cost of power would have been very high not unlike what maharashtra was now facing with enron the construction of the alamatti power project has been handed over to the karnataka power corporation ltd since the private sector chamundi corporation had quoted rs 1400 crores for the project while the kpcl had quoted rs 700 crores our kpcl has a proven track record and the state government decided to go with itthe chief minister sounded a note of caution to the excise sector and said the government would come down heavily on it if it continued with tax evasion sale of seconds liquor the government had set an ambitious target of rs 2086 crores for the coming year in contrast to rs 1500 crores for 20002001 the revenue from excise had dipped in the midnineties and had registered a 20 per cent increase over the past two years referring to the interim report of the administrative reforms commission headed by mr haranahalli ramaswamy he said the state had taken a giant step forward in pruning the administrative machinery around 80 per cent of the vacancies which had been frozen over the past decade had now been abolished mr krishna said that the proposal to divert the waters of the westflowing nethravati was only to provide drinking water to around 72 taluks in the plains of the state such a diversion of a small quantum of the waters would in no way affect the agricultural operations along the natural course of the river the government would hold discussions with all the political leaders before arriving at a decision on the proposal he said the chief minister denied the opposition charge on the financial position of the state and said there was no question of walking into a debt trap the loans sought were well within limits the budget presented by him was quite transparent and there was nothing that he had hidden from the public the focus of the budget this year was on agriculturecopyright  2000 dow jones  company inc all rights reserved country buzzbroadband services miles

country the response to the first few months of broadband connectivity in some affluent localities in delhi and mumbai have been lukewarm mainly because of the cost factor to make matters worse for the industry major players like spectranet and enron have made their intentions clear to exit from their broadband ventures they have set up in delhi and maharashtra respectively spectranet promoter atul punj has decided to withdraw from the fibre optic network business and concentrate on the family s core businesses of construction and pipelines say top sources in the firm the decision follows from the realisation that the business would be dominated by large groups and multinationals analysts too opine that after a frenzied start the broadband market will settle down with fewer players reliance bharti enterprises bpl zee and a few others are left in the fraylast fortnight enron also decided to exit from its broadband ventures in the country along with mseb and global telesystems the company had proposed to build a highspeed network in india to enable isps and corporate houses to carry out their business efficiently it had plans to build a rs 600 crore optical fibre cable network covering 5000 kms across maharashtra strategies to cope why has broadband failed to take off in india siddhartha ray managing director data access an affiliate of richard li s pacific convergence corp pcc that has launched network of the world now in india quips it s easy to talk about sexier technologies but are there any taker for them as well according to him shelling out more than rs 1000 per month besides coughing up cash for a cable modem is not a sneeze for most of the home pc users another reason points out ray is that players like spectranet can t be compared to big giants like reliance who are into a long haul for spectranet return on investment is vital and with the business plans already going astray they are desperate to get out of this venture he points out while both the broadband players in delhi spectranet and mantra online admit that there is future potential in the home segment for broadband their current subscription figures point out that the boom among home users for broadband services is still a long way off spectranet currently has around 1000 subscribers in the home segment while mantra has to make do with 500 only as spectranet managing director uday punj says we are not aggressively marketing the home segment now as the potential in the business segment will any day outflank home demand only that probably they won t be in the market to see that spectranet which was the first off the block in laying optical fibre connections in delhi formally launched its services in october last year the company has already invested around rs 160 crore in setting up 600 kms of optical fibre in delhi noida ghaziabad and bangalore the other broadband player mantra online came with its mantraviacable offer last august mantra s broadband service has till date only covered a few affluent colonies in delhi while one big winner in the delhi s notsohot broadband connections scene has been the cable operators who have provided the crucial lastmile connectivity for both mantra and spectranet via their existing network of coaxial cables a major deterrent in the spread of broadband has been the exorbitant cost of the cable modem they come at around rs 15000 the return is still not alluring return on investment essentially for the broadband environment the major costs include those of the infrastructure and the subscriber those who are in the process of optical fibre networks are investing about rs 100200 crore for covering small towns to large cities more than 15 companies have already acquired infrastructure providers  licences which enable them to set up the network right of way towers and infrastructure for endtoend connectivity these companies include industry heavyweights like reliance bharti rpg satyam infoway and shyam two public sector companies power grid corp of india and gas authority have also entered the race spectranet reliable internet ice netnet rpg netcom atlanta capital potential solutions s kumars satyam infotel and zoom are the other companies that have got an ip licence some of these companies plan to operate telephony services as well these include reliance bharti and shyam the ip licences which are free of cost enable them to set up the backbone network these companies will acquire national long distance nld licences which has an entry fee of rs 500 crore once their networks are ready reliance has acquired the ip licence through a new companysteadfast construction and engineeringset up specially for this purpose as per reliance s plans it will first set up a network in 12 states in two years it will cover the whole country it has already started laying the cable in major states including gujarat delhi and uttar pradesh the company s nld plan has synergy with its existing telecom operations it has basic service licence for gujarat and is operating cellular services in madhya pradesh bihar orissa the north east west bengal assam and himachal pradesh it covers more than 30 per cent of the geographical area of the country therefore it will also be able to use the same optical fibre network as the backbone for its existing operations as well as for carrying longdistance calls similarly bharti has also announced its plans to enter the nld service segment through spectranet bharti would be able to offer basic services in delhi and bangalore much ahead of the other players like reliance and essar bharti which has itself laid about 100 km of optic fibre in delhi has applied for basic telephony licences in eight states including delhi and karnataka great expectations despite the hype worldwide broadband penetration is presently very low and india is no exception take for example the united states where only 18 per cent of homes have broadband access while 27 per cent have narrowband access however most analysts say that in the next five years at least 50 per cent of online homes in the us will have broadband access via modems however the asiapacific region is moving faster than the west as far as broadband connectivity is concerned for instance singapore is fully broadbandwired similarly taiwan also has an extensive broadband network in place in india it is expected that seven companies will soon be offering their fibreoptic cable network commercially internet access via cable will make further inroads into consumer homes as bandwidth prices shrink it will find more consumers in the institutional segment but then even the cable tv penetration is expected to grow only about 15 per cent in 2001 that makes broadband initiative limpcopyright  2000 dow

intense thancalifornia s by jim robbinsnew york timesbutte mont  the last largescale metal mine is silent in this city that sits astride the rocky mountains the 170ton housesized orehauling trucks which once rumbled with loads 24 hours a day have not fired up their engines since last summer nor have the conveyors the crushers the concentrators and the grinders and most of the 320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper molybdenum and silver from the 600foot deep continental pit have scattered to other states and other jobs montana resources which owns the mine has been out of affordable power for nine months at the beginning of 2000 the mine was paying 26 a megawatt hour up from 19 the year before last week however a megawatt hour cost 320 while california has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power crisis caused by deregulation gone awry  rolling blackouts resumed there last week  another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in montana  and in some ways it is far more striking in its impact while californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs montanans are not paper companies mines and other large industrial companies in montana have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric bills residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as double by july 2002 a growing number of montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when their state blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power had some of the lowest electricity rates in the country many residents are directing their anger at the legislature which in their view deregulated the market for electrical power solely at the behest of the montana power co once the state s dominant utility under deregulation that took effect three years ago montana power sold its hydroelectric and coalfired generating plants to ppl corp the allentown pa company that sells power in 42 states and in canada great britain and latin america like other owners of power generation sites ppl has been profiting immensely under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and demand montana power still distributes electric power around the state but soon will be getting out of that business as well the change has left large power consumers such as montana resources scrambling to survive they have scoured the region for affordable alternatives they have asked ppl to make at least some cheaper electricity available but it is unclear if that will happen and they have lobbied the legislature to reregulate electrical power we ve got to play all of our cards said greg stricker president of montana resources as he gazed over the company s open mining pit and a giant statue of the virgin mary that sits high on a mountain above it we re faced with extinction ppl however says it has no choice but to sell its power at market prices on a national scale the plight of montana  which has less than a million people is not as visible as that of california which has 34 million but montana  s experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of control and businesses and consumers are not protected montana  s power crisis is rooted in the history of the montana power co it was formed in 1912 by anaconda copper mining to ensure power for anaconda s extensive mining milling and sawmill operations montana power built hydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state dams that still create power at low cost anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way the company owned most of the state s daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials anaconda the historian bernard devoto wrote maintained a more thoroughgoing ownership of montana  s wealth government and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in any other state the anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by atlantic richfield the oil company that has since been acquired by bp arco closed the mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983 montana power which had become the state s regulated utility outlived its creator by the mid1990s however montana power was worrying about its own future power deregulation a national trend looked inevitable and the company s big industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaper electricity  so trying to make a virtue of necessity montana power began the process of getting out of the power business it diversified creating an internet service provider called touch america it also began to push for power deregulation saying it would result in lower costs and more customer choices the company was hoping that deregulation would make itself attractive to investors and potential buyers a deregulation bill the electric utility restructuring and customer choice act was introduced in march 1997 when the legislative session was nearly over lawmakers most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen approved it hastily to some critics of deregulation the passage smacked of the era when anaconda dictated what the legislature should do few montana lawmakers understood what was happening said ken toole a democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation it was a steamroller with the mantra of free market toole said debate took place in a compressed period of time and it was not brought before the public montana power disputed that interpretation jack haffey its president and chief operating officer said it was not a bill pulled out of somebody s pocket and foisted on the public still montana power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving touch america business the company sold its power plants to ppl investing much of

chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron.com,today enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company here s an update of what we discussed during the callwe told investors that we re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence our focus remains on our credit quality balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businessesit took more than a few weeks to get where we are today here s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation in hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our noncore businesses over the past several years those include investments in azurix india and brazil they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments because of these bad investments we ve become overleveraged as a company the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence which has been very damaging we ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounderstand financial and operating disclosures and on top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as discussed in our 8k filing last week that required a restatement of previously reported earningswe ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under reviewcore businessesour core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company they re our competitive advantage these include natural gas pipeline businesses gas and power businesses in north america and europe retail businesses in north america and europe and coal businesses in north america and europethe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability it s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002i also remain optimistic that the actions we ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns according to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationshipsnoncore businessesour noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division we have invested more than 8 billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismalwe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses we already have more than 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year they include ceg rio a gas ldc in brazil ecoelectrica a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india the approximately 29 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvalsbusinesses under reviewthese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to determine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generationreviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force more information will follow as soon as it becomes availablecredit rating10q filingwe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows moody s at baa3       under review for further downgrade fitch at bbb             evolving status sp at bbb              creditwatch negativewe also discussed our existing financial vehicles including osprey marlin and yosemite in further detail we told investors that we will file our 10q five days late due to our current activities it will be filed on nov 19we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you the full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next few days it

as to how to best handle these services agreements  here are some suggestionspeggy hedstrom in calgary would like to assign the enron canada master services agreements to netco and continue to service those via that entitybridgeline which is a jv in which ena owns a 40 interest currently has no way that they can support themselves  they are totally dependent on enron for everything from email internet network services and office applications as well as trading risk and back office applications  if there are concerns about the estate s ability to support bridgeline then it may be in enron s best interest to assign this agreement to netcoaephpl is more of a stand alone operation  they have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services  they have also brought up with their own version of our scada system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our pipeline operations system  if we sell them our version of pgas to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own trade blotter open link financials and altra  their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in june of this year  given all of the commercial conflicts with aep regarding the sale of hpl it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that aep try to be stand alone asap  that way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed aboveplease let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of service agreements 20tommy j

setup  users rights books global data  is completed and tested on a per application basis some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other203 integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work we will not be testing functional permutations data conditions validation or exceptions to any significant degree204 each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing we are operating from the premise that data infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts204 all systems will be physically split even unify at this point205 integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co206 we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production207 we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes there are two teams  conversion and integration test each team will focus on both estate and new co resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility208 estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest estate conversion is on the critical path for new

is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but ferc has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative   thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutinyferc adds another layer to policy on negotiatedrate authorityacting on a series of contractspecific cases ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is and isnot allowed under negotiated rates in further defining its policy the commission continued to leanheavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority  that a customer not willing or able to negotiate adeal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse ratesduring discussion of the orders chairman pat wood iii said it was important to keep in mind as werush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatorybasis by pipelines last week s proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatorytrend he assertedin representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contractingpractices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and thosethat we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatmentferc declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered anappropriate material deviation from a pipeline s filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse ratesprovide adequate alternatives to other shippersin cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co gt0125 rp99301 tennessee gas pipelineco rp96312 et al and columbia gas transmission corp cp0170 the commission ruled that thebuyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines  generallyavailable tariffsthe provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior tothe end of the deals while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in anegotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities arenot available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the tennessee orderwhere a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides anadequate alternative the commission observed however if the customer desires a special contractdemand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availabilityof service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would notinclude any such provision a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certaindegree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed outa shipper s right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is avaluable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation chargesferc said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory mannerrequiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions underwhich they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights willbe negotiated in a fair manner ferc reasoned once approved the tariff language will require thepipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customerscommissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot inthe arm for a program that had become muddled through a tortured line of cases ferc s definitionsof allowable contracting practices were obscured breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsenseapproach the tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasn t served ourobjective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said
chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,today enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company here s an update of what we discussed during the callwe told investors that we re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence our focus remains on our credit quality balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businessesit took more than a few weeks to get where we are today here s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation in hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our noncore businesses over the past several years those include investments in azurix india and brazil they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments because of these bad investments we ve become overleveraged as a company the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence which has been very damaging we ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounderstand financial and operating disclosures and on top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as discussed in our 8k filing last week that required a restatement of previously reported earningswe ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under reviewcore businessesour core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company they re our competitive advantage these include natural gas pipeline businesses gas and power businesses in north america and europe retail businesses in north america and europe and coal businesses in north america and europethe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability it s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002i also remain optimistic that the actions we ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns according to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationshipsnoncore businessesour noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division we have invested more than 8 billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismalwe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses we already have more than 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year they include ceg rio a gas ldc in brazil ecoelectrica a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india the approximately 29 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvalsbusinesses under reviewthese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to determine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generationreviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force more information will follow as soon as it becomes availablecredit rating10q filingwe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows moody s at baa3       under review for further downgrade fitch at bbb             evolving status sp at bbb              creditwatch negativewe also discussed our existing financial vehicles including osprey marlin and yosemite in further detail we told investors that we will file our 10q five days late due to our current activities it will be filed on nov 19we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you the full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next few days it

transformation is taking place in them as well import barriers are coming down and attacks against foreign investment are being transmuted into searches to attract foreign investment mexico before its debt collapse in 1982 favored external borrowing over investment to obtain foreign exchange but learned to its dismay that this practice contained its own risks when the debt could not be serviced the philosophic base of development then changed and foreign investment was actively sought as an essential requirement for mexico to augment its exports this outlook was the premise of nafta hugo chvez the president of venezuela rails against primitive neoliberalism neoliberalismo salvaje but nevertheless has kept the country s import tariffs relatively low even as he makes a great effort to obtain foreign direct investment to develop his country s telecommunications and natural gas activities chvez so far has shown a tendency to talk like a marxist much like fidel castro his romantic icon but then act like a capitalistfor many of the world s poorest countries the primordial problem is not the spread of multinational corporations but their inability to participate in the process this is especially true in subsaharan africa their poverty small internal markets and accompanying political instability make them poor destinations for foreign investment other than to exploit minerals for export this does not lead to substantial job creationboth foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more rapidly than world economic growth this is a clear manifestation that the foreign aspect of the world economy is becoming increasingly important if one looks back only 20 years when the dominant economic model in latin america was to develop behind high import barriers and to downplay the importance of exports it is startling how much development thinking has changed in that part of the world east asia with its export orientation became the model and not the preachings of those who advised latin america to look inwardthe bulk of the world s trade is carried on by large corporations this is not a new phenomenon these same corporations are large investors in foreign manufacturing and service activities indeed the two phenomenainvesting and producing in foreign countries and then selling much of the output in still other foreign countries as well as the home marketare inseparableinternational trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate rather than final productschips for computers parts for office machinery engines for automobiles and trucks cotton and wool fabrics for apparel look under the hood of your car the transmission assembly may have elements produced in a number of countries the assembly line in detroit works on a justintime basis to receive the material needed from across the border in windsor ontarioand beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly disruption in the manufacturing processthis goes by the name coproduction the parts are produced in a variety of locations assembled in other places and sold globally much of the sales are within the same multinational corporation say from a parent to a subsidiary intrafirm trade or within the same sector intraindustry trade as goods pass across borders in this fashion the absence of border impediments tariffs lengthy inspection delays is crucial as the automotive example between windsor and detroit exemplifies hence the drive for trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of regional economic integration agreements such as nafta to legally ensure the absence of delays in a justintime worldeconomic integration and by extension the process of globalization is centered on competition in particular sectors when it comes to production and merchandise trade what is taking place is a form of division of laboradam smith on a regional and global scale the global aspect is made possible by technology advances in communication and transportation and by financing far more vast than anything seen before corporations take many factors into account when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries such as size of the domestic market the availability and price of labor the cost of transportation and the political stability of the country where the investment is made the growth of us coproduction with mexico was based primarily on two considerations proximity and thus low transportation costs and inexpensive labor most foreign direct investment is made among industrial countries which is evidence that cheap labor is by no means always the dominant criterion this is evident as well from the paucity of investment in the world s poorest countriesif most international trade is conducted by large corporations what does this imply for the future of small and mediumsized enterprises in just about all countries goods and services that are not internationally traded are more voluminous than tradables in addition many large corporations have concluded that making all inputs inhouse is not the most efficient practice and instead are subcontracting to independent producers and service providersand many of these are relatively small enterprises their products are then exported indirectly via the exports of the large corporationsthere is no intent in this discussion to assert that multinational corporations invariably provide their workers with optimal working conditions and good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental degradation in their operations we know that many corporations are not that meticulous even though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign transplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises we know that foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries although by now it is clear that there are many more winners we know that the global spread of business benefits some countries more than others and that some regions of countries prosper while others lag behind the globalization geniein the form of investment trade financial flows and technology advancesis out of the bottle the
