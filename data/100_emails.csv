( b ) notice of changes : we have previously discussed with you what procedureshould be adopted by enron to notify counterparties of the change in the etaor gtcs . to improve any argument that a counterparty has freely consentedto an amended agreement , we would advise that enron adopt a procedure fornotifying counterparties of the altered agreements in advance of them takingeffect . this notice should not be a contractual obligation , rather aninternal enron procedure . that said , we understand from our meeting thatthere may be emergency situations requiring an immediate change to anagreement , with the result that trading is suspended under the oldagreement . if those circumstances are likely to be the bulk of cases whenamendments are to be made , then the notice process may not necessarily beappropriate . if notice is not given , then enron would be relying on thefollowing elements as asserting that a counterparty freely accepted theamended agreement : ( i ) that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended ( and if mark-ups are provided , that the changes were indicated ) ; and ( ii ) that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience inthe speed and pace of the commodities trading industry . these elements are not conclusive but would give enron an argument that thecounterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement . ( c ) overseas counsel : advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the etaand gtcs did not specify that enron would not be giving the counterparty aperiod of notice of changes to the agreements , during which the counterpartycould continue to trade . therefore , if it is ultimately decided that nonotice period will be used , then we may need to seek further advice fromoverseas counsel .7 . eta terminationunder your recent instructions we have amended the eta so that it can onlybe terminated for convenience by enron . that is , there is no expresstermination for convenience right for a counterparty . we have previouslynoted that this means that an eta may continue to be in force with acounterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with enron . advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the eta and gtcs was soughtbased on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice . we will seek furtheradvice from overseas counsel on this issue .8 . website text reviewwe look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of thewebsite to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractualobligations formed using the website .9 . data protectionsince our meetings and conference call , we have discussed further our recentadvice to you on data protection . we are currently seeking the furtheradvice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice toyou shortly .10 . german digital signaturesfurther advice is being sought from german counsel . we will provide youwith a response on this issue shortly . we hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number ofissues . please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any aspect of thismatter . regardstimothy hughes/andrew wilkinson *********************************************************************** the information in this email and in any attachments is confidential and intended solely for the attention and use of the named addressee ( s ) . this information may be subject to legal professional or other privilege or may otherwise be protected by work product immunity or other legal rules . it must not be disclosed to any person without our authority . if you are not the intended recipient , or a person responsible for delivering it to the intended recipient , you are not authorised to and must not disclose , copy , distribute , or retain this message or any part of it .",1999-07-27 06:12:00

------------------------------------------------------------- chinese petrochemical shares rally shares of china s hong kong-listed petrochemical business jumped by 5 % - 10 % yesterday as low prices spurred a buying binge , despite the still poor industry fundamentals . even though the country has an inventory oversupply , the share prices of chemical companies have already reflected the drop in demand and are now seen by many as being a bargain . most of the stocks slumped last summer after several international investment banks cut chemical companies ratings and earnings forecasts because of contracting margins and a surplus of supplies . however , salomon smith barney raised its rating on shares of shanghai petrochemical , a major ethylene producer , from neutral to buy . the company s long-term prospects are still sound and with its dominant domestic market share , shanghai petrochemical seems to be well positioned to take advantage of the expected growth in chemicals , the investment firm said . nonetheless , others say that chinese product prices have dropped since the second half of 2001 . earlier this month , goldman sachs sliced its estimates for 2001/2002 profits for chinese chemical companies due to a drop in chemical margins in the last 2 quarters of 2001 and recent tariff cuts on chemical products following china s entry to the world trade organization . ------------------------------------------------------------- ipe-brent crude futures ( us $ / barrel ) month ?
